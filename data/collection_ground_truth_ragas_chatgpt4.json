Doing experiments in the laboratory reached its limits, as plant growth experiments were hard to conduct in the small confined spaces of a laboratory. It also became questionable whether the results were actually applicable in the real world. Hence experiments literally shifted into fields, with a dramatic effect on their design, conduct and outcome. While laboratory conditions aimed to minimise variance - ideally conducting experiments with a high confidence -, the new field experiments increased sample size to tame the variability - or messiness - of factors that could not be controlled, such as subtle changes in the soil or microclimate. Fisher and his ANOVA became the forefront of a new development of scientifically designed experiments, which allowed for a systematic testing of hypotheses under field conditions, taming variance through replicates. The power of repeated samples allowed to account for the variance under field conditions, and thus compare differences in mean values between different treatments. For instance, it became possible to compare different levels of fertiliser to optimise plant growth.",

There is a first disagreement whether an agent should have a mental state that is able to anticipate the outcome of the action, and such diverse realms as neuroscience and philosophy disagree on that point already. For instance, reflexes are instincts, and it is very difficult to track down whether such actions are intentional and contain assumptions about the outcome. Therefore, broader definitions of agency include the action-based adaptation of an agent to his, her or its environment, which includes also much of the animal kingdom.

        "contexts": "= Some general guidance on the use of statistics =\nWhile it is hard to boil statistics down into some very few important generalities, I try to give you here a final bucket list to consider when applying or reading statistics.\n\n1) '''First of all, is the statistics the right approach to begin with?''' Statistics are quite established in science, and much information is available in a form that allows you to conduct statistics. However, will statistics be able to generate a piece of the puzzle you are looking at? Do you have an underlying theory that can be put into constructs that enable a statistical design? Or do you assume that a rather open research question can be approached through a broad inductive sampling? The publication landscape, experienced researchers as well as pre-test may shed light on the question whether statistics can contribute solving your problem. \n\n2) '''What are the efforts you need to put into the initial data gathering?''' If you decided that statistics would be valuable to be applied, the question then would be, how? To rephrase this statement: How exactly? Your sampling with all its constructs, sample sizes and replicates decides about the fate of everything you going to do later. A flawed dataset or a small or biased sample will lead to failure, or even worse, wrong results. Play it safe in the beginning, do not try to overplay your hand. Slowly edge your way into the application of statistics, and always reflect with others about your sampling strategy. \n\n3) '''The analysis then demands hand-on skills, as implementing tests within a software is something that you learn best through repetition and practice.''' I suggest you to team up with other peers who decide to go deeper into statistical analysis. If you however decide against that, try to find geeks that may help you with your data analysis. Modern research works in teams of complementary people, thus start to think in these dimensions. If you chip in the topical expertise of the effort to do the sampling, other people may be glad about the chance to analyse the data.\n\n4) '''This is also true for the interpretation, which most of all builds on experience.''' This is the point were a supervisor or a PhD student may be able to glance at a result and tell you which points are relevant, and which are negotiable. Empirical research typically produces results where in my experience about 80 % are next to negliable. It takes time to learn the difference between a trivial and an innovative result. Building on knowledge of the literature helps again to this end, but be patient as the interpretation of statistics is a skill that needs to ripen, since contexts matters. It is not so much about the result itself, but more about the whole contexts it is embedded in.\n\n5) The last and most important point explores this thought further. '''What are the limitations of your results?''' Where can you see flaws, and how does the multiverse of biases influence your results and interpretation? What are steps to be taken in future research? And what would we change if we could start over and do the whole thing again? All these questions are like ghosts that repeatedly come to haunt a researcher, which is why we need to remember we look at pieces of the puzzle. Acknowledging this is I think very important, as much of the negative connotation statistics often attracts is rooted in a lack of understanding. If people would have the privilege to learn about statistics, they could learn about the power of statistics, as wells its limitations. \n\n'''Never before did more people in the world have the chance to study statistics.''' While of course statistics can only offer a part of the puzzle, I would still dare to say that this is reason for hope. If more people can learn to unlock this knowledge, we might be able to move out of ignorance and more towards knowledge. I think it would be very helpful if in a controversial debate everybody could dig deep into the available information, and make up their own mind, without other people telling them what to believe. Learning about statistics is like learning about anything else, it is lifelong learning. I believe that true masters never achieve mastership, instead they never stop to thrive for it.",

His contribution was based on work from Francis Galton and Auguste Bravais. With more data becoming available and the need for an \u201cexact science\u201d as part of the industrialization and the rise of modern science, the Pearson correlation paved the road to modern statistics at the beginning of the 20th century. While other approaches such as the t-test or the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) by Pearson's arch-enemy Fisher demanded an experimental approach, the correlation simply required data with a continuous measurement level. Hence it appealed to the demand for an analysis that could be conducted based solely on measurements done in engineering, or on counting as in economics, without being preoccupied too deeply with the reasoning on why variables correlated. Pearson recognized the predictive power of his discovery, and the correlation analysis became one of the most abundantly used statistical approaches in diverse disciplines such as economics, ecology, psychology and social sciences. Later came the \u200bregression analysis, which implies a causal link between two continuous variables. This makes it different from a correlation, where two variables are related, but not necessarily causally linked. This article focuses on correlation analysis and only touches upon regressions.

The assumption of this method, that birds live in pairs in non-overlapping territories, is false for some species such as polygynous species and polyterritorial species. As there is a large proportion of subjectivity involved even when a standard protocol is used, inter-observer variation can be an issue (1). The main bias for point counts is that the length of time spent in the field is rather short. Therefore, the results can be strongly influenced by weather conditions. For this reason, strong winds, rain or cold weather are unsuitable for point counts (1).

It was now necessary to break up the previously assumed stable structures and let them collapse (3).

The figure on the right exemplifies the linguistic sign tree with its two components - the content level (signified) and the expression level (signifier). According to Saussure, a signifier is assigned - arbitrarily but nevertheless unambiguously - to a signified, and the meaning of the signified results from the demarcation of the signifier from other signifiers - often as binary opposites (3, 6). The idea is that the tree  - the signified - can be unambiguously explained by the word \u201etree\u201c \u2013 the signifier - because the word \u201etree\u201c can clearly be differentiated from other words.",

At the same time, plant in this case is also another linguistic sign. If one now also does not know the meaning of the sign plant, one again looks up the signifier P L A N T.

        "contexts": "Methods can further be distinguished into whether they are inductive or deductive. Deductive reasoning builds on statements or theories that are confirmed by observation or can be confirmed by logic. This is rooted deeply in the tradition of Francis Bacon and has become an important baseline of especially the natural sciences and research utilising quantitative methods. While Bacon can be clearly seen as being more leaning towards the inductive, he paved the road towards a clearer distinction between the inductive and the deductive. If there is such a thing as the scientific method at all, we owe much of the systematic behind it to Bacon. Inductive methods draw conclusions based on data or observations. Many argue that these inferences are only approximations of a probable truth. Deriving the knowledge from data and not from theory in inductive research can be seen as a counterpoint to hypothesis-driven deductive reasoning, although this is not always the case. While research even today is mostly stated to be clearly either inductive or deductive, this is often a hoax. You have many folks using large datasets and stating clear hypotheses. If these folks were honest, it would become clear that they analysed the data until they had these hypotheses, yet they publish the results with hypotheses they pretend they had from the very beginning. This is a clear indicator of scientific tradition getting back at us which, up until today, is often built on a culture that demands hypothesis building. Then again, other research is equally dogmatic in demanding an inductive approach, widely rejecting any deduction. Here we will not discuss the merits of inductive reasoning here, but will only highlight that its openness and urge to avoid being deterministic provides an important and relevant counterpoint to deductive research. Just as in the realms of quantitative and qualitative methods, there is a deep trench between inductive and deductive research. One possibility to overcome this in an honest and valuable approach would be abductive reasoning, which consists of iterations between data and theory. Modern research is actually framed and conducted in such a way with a constant exchange between data and theory. Considering the complexity of modern research, this also makes sense: on the one hand, not all research can be broken down into small hypothesisable units, and on the other hand, so much knowledge already exists, which is why much research builds on previous theories and knowledge. Still, today, and for years to come, we will have to acknowledge that much of modern research to date will fall into the traditionally established inductive or deductive category. It is therefore not surprising that critical theory and other approaches cast doubt over these rigid criteria, and the knowledge they produce. Nevertheless, they represent an important categorisation for the current state of the art of many areas of science, and therefore deserve critical attention, least because many methods imply either one or the other approach.",

Some methods are operationalised on a global scale, while others focus on the individual. For instance, a statistical correlation analysis can be applied on data about individuals gathered in a survey, but also be applied to global economic data. A global spatial scale of sampling is defined by data that covers the whole globe, or a non-deliberately chosen part of the globe. Such global analyses are of increasing importance, as they allow us to have a truly united understanding of societal and natural phenomena that concern the global scale. An individual scale of sampling is a scale that focuses on individual objects, which includes people and other living entities. The individual scale can give us deep insight into living beings, with a pronounced focus on research on humans. Since our concepts of humans are diverse, there are also many diverse approaches found here, and many branches of science focus on the individual. This scale certainly gained importance over the last decades, and we are only starting to understand the diversity of knowledge that an individual scale has to offer. In between, there is a huge void that can have different names in different domains of science - landscapes, systems, institutions, catchments, and others. Different branches of science focus on different mid-scales, yet this is often considered to be one of the most abundantly investigated scales, since it can generate a great diversity of data. We will call it the system scale. A system scale of sampling is defined by any scale that contains several individual objects that interact or are embedded in a wider matrix surrounding. Regarding our understanding of systems, this is a relevant methodological scale, because it can generate a great diversity of empirical data, and many diverse methods are applied at this scale. In addition, it is also quite a relevant scale in terms of normativity because it can generate knowledge about change in systems which can be operationalised with the goal to foster or hinder such change. Hence, this system scale can be quite relevant in terms of knowledge that focuses on policy. Changing the globe takes certainly longer, and understanding change in people has many deeper theoretical foundations and frameworks.",

Looking at the epistemology of statistics, we learned that much of modern civilisation is built on statistical approaches, such as the design and analysis of Experiments or the correlation of two continuous variables. Statistics propelled much of the exponential growth in our society, and Statistics is responsible for many of the problems we currently face through our unsustainable behaviour. After all, Statistics was willing to utilize means and accomplish goals that led us more into the direction of a more unsustainable path. Many would argue now that if statistics were a weapon, itself would not kill. Instead, it would be the human hand that uses it. This is insofar true as statistics would not exist without us, just as weapons were forged by us. However, I would argue that statistics are still deeply normative, as they are associated with our culture, society, social strata, economies and so much more. This is why we should embrace a critical perspective on statistics. Much in our society depends on statistics, and many decisions are taken because of statistics. As we have learned, some of these statistics might be problematic or even wrong, and consequently, this can render the decisions wrong as well. More strangely, our statistics can be correct, but as we have learned, statistics can even then contribute to our downfall, for instance when they contribute to a process that leads to unsustainable production processes. We may calculate something correctly, but the result can be morally wrong. Ideally, our statistics would always be correct, and the moral implications that follow out of our actions that are informed by statistics are also right.",

What if you could save 5 people, but you would know that somebody else then dies through the action that saves the other five. Many people prefer not to act. To them, an inaction is ethically more ok than the actual act, which would make them responsible for the death of one person, even if they saved five times as many people. This is also related to knowledge and certainty. Much knowledge exists that should lead people to act, but they prefer to not act at all. Obviously, this is a great challenge, and while psychology investigates this knowledge-action gap, I propose that it will still be here to stay for an unfortunately long time. If people were able to emotionally connect to information derived from numbers, just as the example above, and would be able to act reasonable, much harm could be avoided or at least minimised. This consequentialism is widely missing to date, albeit much of our constructed systems are based on quite similar rules. For instance, many people today do in fact understand that their actions have a negative impact on the climate, but nevertheless continue with these actions. Hence it is not only an inaction between knowledge and action, but also a gap between constructed systems and individuals. There is much to explore here, and as Martha Nussbaum rightly concluded in the Monarchy of Fear, even under dire political circumstances, hope really is both a choice and a practical habit. Hence it is not only utilitarianism that links statistics to ethics, but these questions also links to the social contract, and how we act reasonably or unreasonably. Many experimental modifications of the Trolley experiment were investigated by Psychology, and these led to many interpretations on why people act unreasonably. One main result is that humans may tend to minimize the harm they do to others, even if this may create more harm to people on an indirect level. Pushing a lever is a different thing from pushing a person.",

This is what makes Derek Parfits work stand out, since he tried to connect the different dots, and it will be the work of the next decades to come to build on his work, and improve it if necessary. While philosophy and statistics both face a struggle to align different lines of thinking, it is even more concerning how little these two are aligned with each other. Statistics make use of philosophy at some rare occasions, for instance when it comes to the ethical dilemmas of negatively affecting people that are part of a study. While these links are vital for the development of specific aspects of statistics, the link between moral philosophy and statistics has hardly been explored so far. In order to enable statistics to contribute to the question how we ought to act, a systematic interaction is needed. I propose that exploring possible links is a first step, and we start to investigate how such connections work. The next step would be the proposal of a systematic conceptualisation of these different connections. This conceptualisation would then need to be explored and amended, and this will be very hard work, since both statistics and moral philosophy are scattered due to a lack of a unified theory, and hardly anyone is versatile in both fields.. This makes a systematic exploration of such a unifying link even more difficult to explore is the question who would actually do that.

Consequently, the samples and treatment combinations need to be randomised within the different blocks, or can be alternatively replicated within these blocks. This has become established as a standard approach in the designing of experiments, often for rather pragmatic reasons. For instance are agricultural fields often showing local characteristics in terms of soil and microclimate, and these should be tamed by the clear designation of blocks and enough blocks in total within the experiment. The last point is central when thinking in terms of variance, since it would naturally be very hard to think in terms of variance regarding e.g. only two blocks. A higher number of blocks allow to better tame the block effect. This underlines the effort that often needs to go into designing experiments, since a sufficient number of blocks would basically mean that the effort can be multiplied by the number of blocks that are part of the design.

The first step is however checking the p-value. Which treatments are significant, and which ones are not? When it comes to two-way ANOVAs, we may need to reduce the model to obtain a minimum adequate model. This basically equals a reduction of the full model into the most parsimonious version, following Occam's razor. While some researchers tend to report the full model, with all non-significant treatments and treatment combinations, I think this is wrong. If we reduce the model, the p-values change. This can make the difference between a treatment that is significant, and a non-significant model. Therefore, model reduction is being advised for.

Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between random and fixed factors. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design.

In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics.

Whatever we do as researchers, we have to start with what was done before. Reading is the most essential skill of any person new to research. Balance is key to this end. If you read everything there is on a specific topic, then you are in for a long ride. Otherwise, if you miss something important that has been published before, you basically reinvent the wheel, which is a waste of your times and the time of your readers. Hence, make sure that you get the main approaches that have been attempted before, and the main knowledge that has been gained. You will eventually have to make a cut at some point, otherwise you would basically read everything there is, since almost everything is connected. Hence try to focus on what is specific for your topic and for the area you focus on, thereby gaining some insights about the respective contexts. contexts knowledge matters to this end, because only if you know the contexts of the specific topic, it allows you to aim with the right ratio of focus and distance. Why both? If you look too close, your knowledge is too singular, too specific, or just beyond the point, or any point at all. If it is too broad, it may be generic, trivial, and thus again beyond any point whatsoever once more. Ideally, you work in a specific system. This may be a group of people, and institution, or any other constructed entity. This allows you to add specificity to your research topic. You aim at creating knowledge about this system, people or entity. Hence your framing can be about a specific topic, an entity or institution, but also about a theory. What matters to this end is to have the right angle. Did you ever try to look at a painting from the side? Basically, this does not work, because the framing will block the view, and you do not see the picture. In framing your research, this is basically the same. You need to have the same angle, not from the side, but up front. Within research, we often look at a topic or problem through a certain theory. While testing a theory is restricted to deductive research, regarding a research question our framing and viewpoint is more open minded. It is thus not restricted to the yes/no categories of a hypothesis, but instead allows us to ask a broader question that allows us to create contextual and novel knowledge.",

This problem can be strongly associated to the dominating reign of deductive approaches during this time, which was a suitable line of thinking in psychology, physics, agricultural research, biology or other fields, yet did not only pose an epistemological shortcoming, but was in addition not suitable for parts of science and knowledge production that built on inductive reasoning.

The research focus in Law partly shifted, both in terms of research questions and methodology: \"[i]n the 1960s and 1970s, legal realists and socio-legal scholars started the law and society movement, and pointed to the importance of understanding the gap between 'law in books' and 'law in action', and the operation of law in society. They were interested in examining the legal system in terms of whether legal reform brings about beneficial social effects and protects the interests of the public. Similarly, in the 1980s critical legal studies integrated ideas and methods found in disciplines such as sociology, anthropology and literary theory.\" (McConville & Chui 2007, p.5). With Law being a discipline between the Sciences and the Humanities, this new movement borrowed heavily from the Social Sciences in terms of methodology. New adjacent disciplines emerged, including legal sociology, legal psychology and law and economics, among others (2, 5). This 'Law in contexts' - also called 'socio-legal' - approach includes new topics and methodological directions with a stronger focus on empirical research and theory building and has been universally taken up in academic institutions.",
        "summary": "A second approach to legal research developed from the 17th Century onwards, mainly from the 19th Century until today. This approach was influenced by the rise of positivism, which posits that valid knowledge comes from scientific inquiry and falsification of scientific theory. This led to a shift in the focus of legal research, with an emphasis on empirical data, hypothesis testing, and theory development. In the 1960s and 1970s, legal realists and socio-legal scholars started the law and society movement, focusing on the gap between 'law in books' and 'law in action', and the operation of law in society. This 'socio-legal' approach, which includes new topics and methodological directions with a focus on empirical research and theory building, has been universally adopted in academic institutions.",

It was more than 35 years later that within psychology the next relevant Meta-Analysis was published: the book-length \"Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years\", authored by Pratt et al. in 1940, summarizing experimental results from 1882 to 1939 (1). Despite some few studies being compiled over the next decades (most based on clinical research), more sophisticated statistical analysis tools emerging after WW2 ultimately sealed the breakthrough of the method. In the 1970s, Gene V. Glass - together with many other statisticians - developed what he called the 'analysis of the analyses' (2). By integrating statistical results into a meta-analytical frame, it became possible to combine results from the at the time already rising number of publications. Another key development was the availability of modern computers, which allowed for the conducting pf the more sophisticated analyses, along with more studies becoming available online with the rise of the Internet. Meta-analysis thus represents a method where the demand for knowledge of a different order became possible because the general data basis increased, and advanced analyses were made possible by developments in statistics and the wider availability of technology.

Even the integration of data within tables poses many unsolved problems. For instance, different methods can have not only a different understanding but also diverging indications of validity and plausibility. While these are pivotal in the realms of quantitative data but also in logic, validity and plausibility may be totally wrong criteria regarding much knowledge from qualitative domains where contexts and transferability - or the lack thereof - are more relevant. Some forms of knowledge are important to many, while other forms of knowledge are important to few.

Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem.",

Albeit it does not provide detailed insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the variables investigated, it is a good first analysis to get an overview of what is going on. Correlation describes a linear relationship between at least two variables. It ranges between -1 and 1, which are called perfect positive and perfect negative correlation respectively. For example, a correlation between income (in Euros) and education (in years of schooling) of 0.5 indicates that there is a positive linear relationship between an increase in education and income. The most common approach to assessing corelation is via regression analysis. In regression analysis, a relationship between one dependent variable and at least on independent variable is assessed. With the help of the regression analysis, the effect of a change in the independent variable(s) by one unit on the dependent variable is modelled. This model therefore tries to find the linear curve that is best representing the actual relationship between the dependent and the independent variable(s). Returning to the example of income and education, we can set income to be the dependent variable and education as the independent variable. We can also add other variables affecting income, such as average wages in the country of the workplace (GDP), or relevant working experiences (in months of experience). With the regression analysis, we can then assess the change in income with a one unit increase of education and working experience, and an increase in GDP when having an international dataset. One of the most used estimators for assessing correlation is the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS). The OLS aims to produce a linear curve whose values minimize the sum of the squared values of the dependent variable and the predicted values from the regression equation. The OLS estimator relies on a number of assumptions that cannot be discussed in detail, but you can find them [https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-in-ols-regression-why-do-they-matter-9501c800787dXX here].",

This is an important difference to Correlations, which only revolve around the relation between variables without assuming - or testing for - a causal link. Thus, identifying regressions can help us infer predictions about future developments of a relation. Within a regression analysis, a dependent variable is explained by an independent variable, both of which are continuous. At the heart of any regression analysis is the optimisation of a regression line that minimises the distance of the line to all individual points. In other words, the least square calculation maximizes the way how the regression line can integrate the sum of the squares of all individual data points to the regression line.

This principle defines that we humans value everything that occurs in the close past or future to be more relevant than occurrences in the distant future or past. This is even independent of the likelihood whether future events will actually happen. As an example, imagine that you want to have a new computer every few years, and you can pay 5\u20ac to have a 50% chance to get a new computer tomorrow. If you actually needed one, you would surely do that. However, even adjusted for inflation, many people would not pay the same 5\u20ac to have a 50 % chance to win the latest computer in 10 years. What difference does it make? It is the latest tech in any case. Temporal discounting is one of the main ways how people act unreasonably. This even extends well beyond the point where we are dead already, although this also plays a role. Our unreasonable inabilities to transcend temporal discounting extend likewise into the past. The strongest argument to this end is how many people insist that they are worse off today when compared to the past - in the 'good old days'. The mistake that is typically made is that some aspects in the past were better, while many other aspects were worse. People hence have a tendency to value the time period closer to them different from the time periods more distant. For the past, only the good things are remembered, and for the present, the negative sides are also acknowledged. It widely depends on other circumstances whether this unreasonable evaluation is better or worse than a more objective view on each time period. In any case, the sheer difference between how people evaluate distant time periods or events compared to closer ones is one indirect motivation for science to put this knowledge into perspective.",

Be measuring the decay of radionucleids in the objects, it is today possible to get a rather good tracking of the age of fossils. However, before the establishment of this hard scientific method, palaeontologists and geologists relied widely on the contexts of the sediments in which the fragments were found. The sedimental history hence become an early dating method, and many other indicators such as thin layers of global catastrophes through meteors allow to pinpoint the temporal origins with an often high precision. One prominent example is the layer at the Cratecous-Tertiary line, when an Earth-shattering meteor not only extinguished the dinosaurs, but also created a thin sedimental layer that allows to date this event in time with often remarkable precision. Other important methods in dating distant developments can be hidden in the molecules and systematics of many organisms, since sophisticated DNA analysis often allow to generate a holistic developmental history of organisms if suitable material for DNA analysis is found.

Multidisciplinarity revolves around the cooperation between different academic disciplines for one research endeavour. The researchers study the same topic in a parallel structure and all have their distinct goals and research questions. They share knowledge and compare their findings and may also combine their results in one big report, but the disciplinary boundaries generally remain intact. Interdisciplinarity is a research mode that deploys a higher level of cooperation between researchers from different, often rather unrelated disciplines. Disciplinary viewpoints are crossed and integrated to develop new perspectives in order to create new knowledge or re-assess existing, disciplinary knowledge. As an example, political scientists and ecologists may come together to jointly study a eco-political issue. Transdisciplinarity, then, can be seen as the next higher step. Transdisciplinarity is a reflexive, integrative, method-driven scientific principle aiming at the solution or transition of societal problems and concurrently of related scientific problems by differentiating and integrating knowledge from various scientific and societal bodies of knowledge.",

However, there has been an increasing recognition that disciplinary viewpoints and approaches may no longer be sufficient to solve prevalent challenges that span across several scientific and societal spheres. Examples for this are ecological threats such as biodiversity loss or socio-technological challenges such as digitalisation which demand the creation of new theoretical and empirical scientific insights, but also action-oriented solutions that can be applied in policy, business, education, culture and such. With his landmark 1994 publication, Michael Gibbons introduced the term Mode 2 research which highlights this emerging form of scientific inquiry that is characterised by closer interaction between scientific, technological and industrial modes of knowledge production, by the weakening of disciplinary and institutional boundaries, by the emergence of more or less transient clusters of experts, often grouped around large projects of various kinds, and by the broadening of the criteria of quality control and by enhanced social accountability.",

        "contexts": "The next point is a very delicate one: Research questions vs. hypotheses. Let us start with the more simple point. How much of those should you have? It is really difficult to answer one question. This is something that philosophers may do, but most research demands more questions that build on each other. See it from a structural point of view, answering one question pre-structures your introduction into one big blob of text. That is certainly not convenient. 2-5 questions seem ideal, because -let's face it- it is really hard to remember more than 5 things intuitively. We then tend to forget, and it also has the drawback to make your research seem \u00fcber-structured. Hence it can be a good heuristic to have 2-5 research questions or hypotheses. Now let us move to the more troubling part, which is the question whether it is research questions or hypotheses. From a philosophy of science standpoint, the two should be mutually exclusive. While hypotheses are surely deductive and demand a clear confirmation or rejection, research questions are somewhat more open and hence inductive. Thus while the latter has never been clear cut, it can be helpful to draw such a clear line. Some folks may now raise the streetwise question whether we should not all be thinking abductively anyway? In a sense this is where all science moves anyway, because we need both inductive and deductive approaches, and ideally combines the benefits of both in the long run. Yet this is mainly a questions of both experience and temporal grain. Working abductively means that you can clearly remark between hypotheses and research questions, because the first demand a very clear structure, while the latter are way more open. There is an underlying relation that hypotheses tend to be more quantitative, while research questions are often more qualitative. Still, this is a mere correlation and not a really causal relation, but it confuses a great many people. Chasing whether to write hypotheses or research questions is in addition often a question of the tradition of the respective scientific discipline. Many folks in natural science are still proud of their razor sharp hypotheses, and other fellow within socials science lean clearly towards research questions. Ideally, find out what your supervisors demand, which is the most simple heuristic to this end. Still, this point underlines that from a philosophy of science standpoint the silo-mentality of disciplines has its reason, but does not always make sense. What is most important for you is that an adductive procedure may be most desirable, yet only in the long run. It is part of the tradition of many sciences the postulate, test, and adjust. This works more on a time-scale of years or decades, but thus demands a temporal grain of a longer research agenda. Hence an abductive is not suitable for a shorter project such as a thesis.",

In an ethnographic study this can be a specific group of people. Within a lab experiments it can be a completely artificially designed study, such as a set of planting pots that are irrigated, shaded and endure different temperature settings. This the study area is the specific system or setting that is being investigated. Again, there is a certain tradition that deductive studies are more tamed or have a deeper control or understanding of their study area, while inductive studies are more open minded and less clear cut when it comes the the pre-study understanding of the study area. Yet do not be fooled, inductive studies can be very clear when it comes to looking at something specific, these studies do it just with a different kind of open-mindedness. What is the benefit for you is to be clear in defining where you want to work in, may it be inductive or deductive. It is helpful to have a clear definition, because otherwise you will be either overworking yourself or have a sample set that is too small. The study area should ideally be chosen to make it very clear how your research represents some dynamics, pattern or mechanisms that can either serve as a basis to approximate reproducible knowledge, or at least knowledge where the path towards it can be clearly documented. Hence the study area is something that allows you to make your research specific and thus tamed. Your choice remarks a start as well as an end.
