First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI."],"1":["In addition, the original ANOVA builds on balanced designs, which means that all categories are represented by an equal sample size. Extensions have been developed later on in this regard, with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers."],"2":["[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-04-15 um 17.18.08.png|thumb|Another simple example for calculating probability which you have probably also discussed in school is flipping a coin.

Here, an imperfect or a small sample would serve as basis for statistical interference. Very crudely defined, the two approaches start at exact opposite ends. While frequency statistics demand preconditions such as sample size and a normal distribution for specific statistical tests, Bayesian statistics build on the existing sample size; all calculations base on what is already there. Experts may excuse my dramatic simplification, but one could say that frequentist statistics are top-down thinking, while [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach\/ Bayesian statistics] work bottom-up. The history of modern science is widely built on frequentist statistics, which includes such approaches as methodological design, sampling density and replicates, and diverse statistical tests. It is nothing short of a miracle that Bayes proposed the theoretical foundation for the theory named after him more than 250 years ago. Only with the rise of modern computers was this theory explored deeply, and builds the foundation of branches in data science and machine learning. The two approaches are also often coined as objectivists for frequentist probability fellows, and subjectivists for folllowers of [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes theorem]."],"3":["'''What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency.''' Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional acts per se. Still, consequentialism and a focus on mere actions is also relevant because it allows to step away from a single agent and focus instead on the interactions within the agency of several actors, which is a good start for the next concept."],"4":["Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework.

This is because \"[s]ustainability is also inherently transdisciplinary\" (Stock & Burton 2011, p.1091), as it builds on the premise of solving real-world problems which are deeply nestled in ecological, political, economic and social processes and structures and therefore cannot be understood and solved without engaging with these spheres (Kates et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary research is a suitable approach for Sustainability Science: it allows to incorporate the knowledge of relevant stakeholders; it considers the normative dimensions involved in societal endeavors (that is, diverging norms, goals and visions of different societal spheres); and it increases [[Glossary|legitimacy]], ownership and accountability for the jointly developed solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Stock & Burton 2011). The integrative transdisciplinary approach highlights systemic interdependencies, enables a better understanding of complex issues and provides better knowledge to develop socially robust and applicable, effective solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2015).\n\n\n== How to do TD in Sustainability Science ==\nHere, we will refer to the ideal-typical model presented by Lang et al (2012). It introduces a conceptual guide, structured into three phases, on how transdisciplinary research for sustainability science should ideally be conducted. The relevant steps of each phase as well as general principles for the whole process will be listed below. The presented process is recursive: Problems emerging in scientific as well as societal practice are integrated in the transdisciplinary research approach. After its three phases have been realized, the newly generated knowledge and solutions are re-integrated into these two spheres, where they are applied and consolidated. Ultimately, new challenges emerge that demand renewed transdisciplinary collaboration."],"19":["'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense."],"21":["{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || '''[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]''' || '''[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n''Teaching is the best way to learn.''\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it.

This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:"],"22":["Within [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical"],"23":["the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments.

Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong."],"26":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Heatmaps.

As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values."],"27":["Many concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a.

Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections."],"34":["'''In short:''' Mixed Effect Models are stastistical approaches that contain both fixed and random effects, i.e. models that analyse linear relations while decreasing the variance of other factors.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Mixed Effects Model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Mixed Effects Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology."],"35":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many studies in medicine that investigate how a certain drug works on people to cure a disease. To this end, you want to know the effect the drug has on the prognosis of the patients. What you do not want to know is whether people are worse off if they are older, have a lack of exercise or an unhealthy diet. All these single effects do not matter for you, because it is well known that the prognosis often gets worse with higher age, and factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet choices. What you may want to know, is whether the drug works better or worse in people that have unhealthy diet choice, are older or lack regular exercise. These interaction can be meaningfully investigated by Mixed Effect Models. '''All positive factors' variance is minimised, while the effect of the drug as well as its interactions with the other factors can be tested.''' This makes Mixed Effect Models so powerful, as you can implement them in a way that allows to investigate quite complex hypotheses or questions."],"36":["The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values."],"37":["=== Redundancy analysis ==="],"38":["'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights.

This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research.

Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

It is impossible to plot all variables as is onto a flat screen\/paper. Furthermore, high-dimensional data suffers from what is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features \/ dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. '''Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem'''.\n[[File: PCA_BiPlot.png|center|500px]]\n\n== What the method does ==\nPrinciple Component Analysis is one of the foundational methods to combat the curse of dimensionality. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm whose goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, condensing its entirety down to a low number of dimensions (also called principle components, usually two or three). \n\nAlthough it comes with a cost of losing some information, it makes data visualization much easier, improves the space and time complexity required for machine learning algorithms tremendously, and allows for more intuitive intepretation of these models. PCA can also be categorized a feature extraction techniques, since it creates these principle components - new and more relevant features - from the original ones."],"43":["==Homoscedasticity and Heteroscedasticity==\nBefore conducting a regression analysis, it is important to look at the variance of the residuals. In this case, the term \u2018residual\u2019 refers to the difference between observed and predicted data (Dheeraja V.2022).\n\nIf the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore. This does not mean that your results are biased, it only means that another approach can create a linear regression that more adequately models the actual trend in the data. In most cases, you can transform the data in a way that the OLS mechanics function again.\nTo find out if either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity is the case, we can look at the data with the help of different visualization approaches.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"sex\") ## creates a pairplot with a matrix of each variable on the y- and x-axis, but gender, which is colored in orange (hue= \"sex\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored of the final written exam, exercise and number of solved questions among males and females (gender group).\n\nLooking a the graphs along the diagonal line, it shows a higher peak among the male students than the female students for the written exam, solved question (quanti) and exercise points (points). Looking at the relationship between exam and points, no clear pattern can be identified. Therefore, it cannot be safely assumed, that a heteroscedastic dispersion is given.\n[[File:Pic 1.png|700px]]"],"44":["'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2). \n\nToday, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there.

Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).\n\nMoreno's and Jennings' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of ''''group dynamics', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.''' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8)."],"46":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Stacked Area plots.
