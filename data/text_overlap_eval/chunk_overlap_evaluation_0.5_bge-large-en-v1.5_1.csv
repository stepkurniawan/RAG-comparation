0|What is the advantage of A/B testing?|The advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process.|"[""In the case of continuous metrics, such as average revenue per user, the [[T-Test|t-test or Welch's t-test]] may be used to determine the significance of the treatment effect. However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https://data.library.virginia.edu/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate.\n\n==Advantages and Limitations of A/B Testing==\n'''Advantages'''\nA/B testing has several advantages over traditional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a product or design. First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.""]"|0.9999999999|1.0
1|What is the ANOVA a powerful for?|Reducing variance in field experiments or complex laboratory experiments|['In addition, the original ANOVA builds on balanced designs, which means that all categories are represented by an equal sample size. Extensions have been developed later on in this regard, with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.']|0.9999999999|1.0

Here, an imperfect or a small sample would serve as basis for statistical interference. Very crudely defined, the two approaches start at exact opposite ends. While frequency statistics demand preconditions such as sample size and a normal distribution for specific statistical tests, Bayesian statistics build on the existing sample size; all calculations base on what is already there. Experts may excuse my dramatic simplification, but one could say that frequentist statistics are top-down thinking, while [https://365datascience.com/bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach/ Bayesian statistics] work bottom-up. The history of modern science is widely built on frequentist statistics, which includes such approaches as methodological design, sampling density and replicates, and diverse statistical tests.

Only with the rise of modern computers was this theory explored deeply, and builds the foundation of branches in data science and machine learning.

3|Why is acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law challenging in the contexts of agency?|Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging in the contexts of agency because lucky or unlucky actions that were not anticipated by the agents are not included in the definition of agency.|"[""'''What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency.''' Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional acts per se. Still, consequentialism and a focus on mere actions is also relevant because it allows to step away from a single agent and focus instead on the interactions within the agency of several actors, which is a good start for the next concept.""]"|0.9999999999|1.0

This test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between two categorical variables in the dataset.|['Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework.

The challenges it faces include the need for more work to solve problems and create solutions, the importance of how solutions and knowledge are created, the necessity for society and science to work together, and the challenge of building an educational system that is reflexive and interconnected.|"['* Hall & Rourke (2014) expand on communicative challenges, claiming that ""[n]ot all of the challenges that threaten TDSS [transdisciplinary sustainability science] are communication challenges, but communication breakdown can exacerbate any of them.

The explanatory characteristic allowed by Critical Realism might be good enough for the pragmatist, the practical may speak to the modern engagement of science with and for society, and the normative is aware of – well - all things normative, including the critical. Hence a door was opened to a new mode of science, focussing on the situation and locatedness of research within the world. This was surely a head start with Kant, who opened the globe to the world of methods. There is however a critical link in Habermas, who highlighted the duality of the rational individual on a small scale and the role of global societies as part of the economy (Habermas 1987). This underlines a crucial link to the original three foundational theories in philosophy, albeit in a dramatic and focused interpretation of modernity. Habermas himself was well aware of the tensions between these two approaches – the critical and the empirical -, yet we owe it to Critical Theory and its continuations that a practical and reflexive knowledge production can be conducted within deeply normative systems such as modern democracies.""]"|0.9999999999|1.0

It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of \'holistic\' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that ""(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear"" and that ""(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions"" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n\'\'\'Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:\'\'\' hard and soft.

In medical trials, whether someone smokes is usually a random factor, unless the study is specifically about smoking. Factors in a block design are typically random, while variables related to our hypothesis are fixed.|['Within [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic.

This is due to statistical issues such as the arbitrary significance threshold of p=0.05, flaws in the connection between theory and methodological design, and the increasing complexity of statistical models.|['showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments.

Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong.""]"|0.9999999999|1.0

Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required.

He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets.

36|Why should stepwise procedures in model reduction be avoided?|Stepwise procedures in model reduction should be avoided because they are not smart but brute force approaches based on statistical evaluations, and they do not include any experience or preconceived knowledge. They are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way.|['The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values.']|0.9999999999|1.0

38|How are 'narratives' used in Narrative Research?|'Narratives' in Narrative Research are used as a form of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. They are not just representations of events, but a way of making sense of the world, linking events in meaning. They reflect the perspectives of the storyteller and their social contexts, and are subject to change over time as new events occur and perspectives evolve.|"[""'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research.

These models can compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion and outperform linear models when predictors follow a non-linear pattern.

It is impossible to plot all variables as is onto a flat screen/paper. Furthermore, high-dimensional data suffers from what is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features / dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases.

The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were ""(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]"" in the US.

As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the ""Unified Planning Machinery"". The idea was to listen to planners\' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning.
