An important advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A/B tests, the scheme of scientific experiments is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.;A/B testing has the advantage of establishing causal relationships with high probability, transforming decision making into a scientific, evidence-based process.;What is the advantage of A/B testing?;The advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process.
The ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses.;ANOVA is a powerful tool for reducing variance in field experiments or complex laboratory experiments by accounting for variance in repeated measures. It is the most robust method for deductive experiments, but has also been used for inductive data analysis, which goes against Fisher's original idea of clear robust designs and rigid hypothesis testing.;What is the ANOVA a powerful for?;Reducing variance in field experiments or complex laboratory experiments
"Centuries ago, Thomas Bayes proposed a dramatically different approach. Here, an imperfect or a small sample would serve as a basis for statistical inference. Very crudely defined, the two approaches start at exact opposite ends. While frequency statistics demand preconditions such as sample size and a normal distribution for specific statistical tests, Bayesian statistics build on the existing sample size; all calculations base on what is already there. Experts may excuse my dramatic simplification, but one could say that frequentist statistics are top-down thinking, while Bayesian statistics work bottom-up. The history of modern science is widely built on frequentist statistics, which includes such approaches as methodological design, sampling density and replicates, and diverse statistical tests. It is nothing short of a miracle that Bayes proposed the theoretical foundation for the theory named after him more than 250 years ago. Only with the rise of modern computers was this theory explored deeply, and builds the foundation of branches in data science and machine learning. The two approaches are also often coined as objectivists for frequentist probability fellows, and subjectivists for followers of Bayes theorem.";Thomas Bayes introduced a different approach to probability that relied on small or imperfect samples for statistical inference. Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent opposite ends of the spectrum, with frequentist methods requiring specific conditions like sample size and a normal distribution, while Bayesian methods work with existing data. Frequentist statistics have been foundational in modern science, including methodological design and statistical tests, while Bayesian statistics gained prominence with the advent of modern computers, forming the basis of data science and machine learning.;What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to probability, and how have they influenced modern science?;Thomas Bayes introduced a different approach to probability that relied on small or imperfect samples for statistical inference.

What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency. Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional acts per se. Still, consequentialism and a focus on mere actions is also relevant because it allows to step away from a single agent and focus instead on the interactions within the agency of several actors, which is a good start for the next concept.;Actions of agents must be wilful, and serendipitous acts are not part of agency. Non-anticipated consequences based on causal chains pose a problem in agency. Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging. The metaphysical problem arises when differentiating agents, their actions, and consequences. Focusing solely on consequences is a theoretical consideration that doesn't fully address unintentional acts. Consequentialism and a focus on actions allow the study of interactions within agencies of multiple actors.;Why is acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law challenging in the contexts of agency?;Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging in the contexts of agency because lucky or unlucky actions that were not anticipated by the agents are not included in the definition of agency.
"=== Only categorical data: Chi Square Test ===

"==== Generalised Linear Models ====
'''You have arrived at a Generalised Linear Model (GLM).''' GLMs are a family of models that are a generalization of ordinary linear regressions. The key R command is <code>glm()</code>.
Depending on the existence of random variables, there is a distinction between Mixed Effect Models, and Generalised Linear Models based on regressions.
'''How do I know?'''
* Random variables introduce extra variability to the model. For example, we want to explain the grades of students with the amount of time they spent studying. The only randomness we should get here is the sampling error. But these students study in different universities, and they themselves have different abilities to learn. These elements infer the randomness we would not like to know, and can be good examples of a random variable. If your data shows effects that you cannot influence but which you want to 'rule out', the answer to this question is 'yes'.";When you reach a Generalised Linear Model (GLM), you are working with a versatile family of models that extend ordinary linear regressions. GLMs are used to model relationships between variables, and the key R command is <code>glm()</code>.

"Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is the statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the ""noise"" caused by covariate variable that is not of experimental interest. This is done in order to see the true effect of the variable of interest on a dependent variable. Fundamental idea of ANCOVA is based on hypothesis testing, its goal is to evaluate multiple mutually exclusive theories about our [[Glossary|data]], where null hypothesis claims that the means of the groups are equal, and alternative [[Glossary|hypothesis]] rejects that based on p-value. Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.";ANCOVA compares group means while controlling for covariate influence. It involves hypothesis testing with null and alternative hypotheses and considers Sum of Squares partitioning.

"Content Analysis counteracts biases because it ""(...) assures not only that all units of analysis receive equal treatment, whether they are entered at the beginning or at the end of an analysis but also that the process is objective in that it does not matter who performs the analysis or where and when."" (see Normativity) (Krippendorff 1989, p.404). In this case, 'objective' refers to 'intersubjective'. Yet, biases cannot be entirely prevented, e.g. in the sampling process, the development of the coding scheme, or the interpretation and evaluation of the coded data. Content Analysis allows for researchers to apply their own social-scientific constructs ""by which texts may become meaningful in ways that a culture may not be aware of."" (Krippendorff 1989, p.404) However, especially in case of qualitative analysis of smaller data sample sizes, the theory and hypotheses derived from data cannot be generalized beyond this data (1). Triangulation, i.e. the comparison of the findings to other knowledge on the same topic, may provide more validity to the conclusions (see Normativity).";Content Analysis helps counteract biases by ensuring equal treatment of all units of analysis and maintaining objectivity. However, biases can still occur in the sampling process, development of the coding scheme, and interpretation of data.

Triangulation can provide more validity to the conclusions.;What are the strengths and challenges of Content Analysis?;Strengths of Content Analysis include its ability to counteract biases and allow researchers to apply their own social-scientific constructs. Challenges include potential biases in the sampling process, development of the coding scheme, and interpretation of data, as well as the inability to generalize theories and hypotheses beyond the data in qualitative analysis of smaller samples.
Generally, there are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's rank coefficient. Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most popular among them. This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. While Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas Kendall's rank correlation coefficient computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.;There are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's, Spearman's rank, and Kendall's rank.

The correlogram visualizes the calculated correlation coefficients for more than two variables. You can quickly determine whether there is a relationship between the variables or not. The different colors give you also the strength and the direction of the relationship. To create such a correlogram, you need to install the R package corrplot and import the library. Before we start to create and customize the correlogram, we can calculate the correlation coefficients of the variables and store it in a variable. It is also possible to calculate it when creating the plot, but this makes your code more clear.;A correlogram visualizes correlation coefficients for multiple variables, allowing quick determination of relationships, strength, and direction.

Telemetry is another method that was further developed in recent years, although it has been used already for decades in wildlife ecology. Telemetry is “the system of determining information about an animal through the use of radio signals from or to a device carried by the animal” (11). For birds, this method can be applied in areas ranging in size from restricted breeding territories of resident bird species to movement patterns of international migratory species. Also, the distribution patterns of infectious diseases of migratory species can be tracked (11). However, for some birds, negative effects on nesting behavior were observed (12).;Telemetry, a method used in wildlife ecology for decades, has been further developed in recent years.

The most abundant reason for a deviance from the normal distribution is us. We changed the planet and ourselves, creating effects that may change everything, up to the normal distribution. Take weight. Today the human population shows a very complex pattern in terms of weight distribution across the globe, and there are many reasons why the weight distribution does not follow a normal distribution. There is no such thing as a normal weight, but studies from indigenous communities show a normal distribution in the weight found in their populations. Within our wider world, this is clearly different.;Human actions have caused deviations from the normal distribution, such as in weight distribution. Today's global weight distribution is complex and does not follow a normal distribution. However, studies from indigenous communities show a normal weight distribution.;What is a common reason for deviation from the normal distribution?;A common reason for deviation from the normal distribution is human actions, which have caused changes in patterns such as weight distribution.
You can also use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normal distribution. If the test returns insignificant results (p-value > 0.05), we can assume normal distribution. This barplot (at the left) represents the number of front-seat passengers that were killed or seriously injured annually from 1969 to 1985 in the UK. And here comes the magic trick: If you sort the annually number of people from the lowest to the highest (and slightly lower the resolution), a normal distribution evolves (histogram at the left).;The Shapiro-Wilk test can be used to check for normal distribution.

The literature indicates a variety of benefits that the Delphi method offers. Delphi originally emerged due to a lack of data that would have been necessary for traditional forecasting methods. To this day, such a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem remains a reason to choose Delphi. Delphi may also be an appropriate choice if the collective subjective judgment by the experts is beneficial to the problem-solving process. Delphi can be used as a form of group counseling when other forms, such as face-to-face interactions between multiple stakeholders, are not feasible or even detrimental to the process due to counterproductive group dynamics.;The Delphi method offers several benefits.

At the heart of Sustainability Science are, among other elements, the premise of intentionally developing practical and contexts-sensitive solutions to existent problems, as well as the implementation of cooperative research modes to do so jointly with societal actors, supporting social learning and capacity building in society. To this end, Caniglia et al. (2020) suggest three types of knowledge that should be developed and incorporated by Sustainability Science: This showcases that this knowledge - and more importantly - the perspective from a philosophy-of-science viewpoint is only starting to emerge, and much more work will be needed until our methodological canon and the knowledge we want to produce enable us to solve the problems we are facing, but also to create these solution in ways that are closer to a mode how we want to create these solutions. We may well be able to solve certain things, and to produce knowledge that can be seen as solutions. I would however argue, that it also matters how we create these solutions and how we create knowledge. Only if people are empowered and society and science work seamlessly together - with ethical restrictions and guidelines in place, of course - will we not only produce the knowledge needed, but we also produce it in a way how we should as scientists. Science is often disconnected and even arrogant, and building an educational system that is reflexive and interconnected will be maybe the largest challenge we face. This is why we give you these criteria here, because I think that we need to consider what further design criteria can be in order to enhance and diversify our conceptual thinking about the scientific methodological canon. Plurality on scientific methods will necessarily mean to evolve, and in this age of interconnectedness, our journey is only beginning.;Sustainability Science aims to develop practical solutions to existing problems through cooperative research with societal actors.

The initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. We have to recognise that modern science is a system that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.;The history of science, starting from ancient times, has led to the development of scientific methods. However, modern science is flawed as it provides a singular worldview, built on oppression and inequalities. It lacks the necessary link between empirical and ethical consequences. Therefore, critical theory and ethics are essential for researchers.;Why are critical theory and ethics important in modern science?;Critical theory and ethics are important in modern science because it is flawed with a singular worldview, built on oppression and inequalities, and often lacks the necessary link between empirical and ethical consequences.
System thinking gained prominence during the last century, allowing to take interactions and interdependencies into account when investigating a system. To this end, a ‘system’ stands for something that is in the focus of the investigation, such as a catchment area, a business enterprise, a social institution, or a population of wasps. Such systems show signs of complexity, which means that the interactions of smaller entities in the system may be unpredictable or chaotic, which makes systems more than the sum of their parts. Under this definition, solving problems within a system is often the greatest challenge: while the system dynamics may be understandable, the solutions for an emerging problem are not instantly available. Consequently, solutions for complex problems emerge, and this demands a new line of thinking about systems.;System thinking, which considers interactions and interdependencies, became prominent in the last century. A 'system' could be anything under investigation, such as a business or a population of wasps. These systems are complex, with unpredictable interactions making them more than the sum of their parts. Solving problems within these systems is challenging, requiring a new way of thinking as solutions emerge.;What is system thinking?;System thinking is a method of investigation that considers interactions and interdependencies within a system, which could be anything from a business to a population of wasps.
The Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.;The Feynman Method is a learning technique that emphasizes explaining a topic to someone as the best way to understand it. It promotes understanding over memorization, making it easier to apply new knowledge to different situations.;What is the main principle of the Feynman Method?;The main principle of the Feynman Method is that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it.
Within ANOVA designs, the question whether a variable is a fixed or a random factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between random and fixed factors. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical standpoint the value of such pre-tests may be limited at best.;In ANOVA designs, determining whether a variable is a fixed or random factor can be challenging. Fixed effects are the focus of the study, while random effects are aspects we want to ignore. In medical trials, whether someone smokes is usually a random factor, unless the study is specifically about smoking. Factors in a block design are typically random, while variables related to our hypothesis are fixed. Pre-tests are often used to understand the system and check the feasibility of variables.;What is the difference between fixed and random factors in ANOVA designs?;Fixed effects are the focus of the study, while random effects are aspects we want to ignore. In medical trials, whether someone smokes is usually a random factor, unless the study is specifically about smoking. Factors in a block design are typically random, while variables related to our hypothesis are fixed.
There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased.;The replication crisis refers to the inability to reproduce a substantial proportion of modern research, affecting fields like psychology, medicine, and economics. This can be attributed to statistical issues such as the arbitrary significance threshold of p=0.05, flaws in the connection between theory and methodological design, and the increasing complexity of statistical models.;What is the replication crisis and how does it affect modern research?;The replication crisis refers to the inability to reproduce a substantial proportion of modern research, affecting fields like psychology, medicine, and economics.

Generalized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often deductive methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.;Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are statistical analyses that can handle specific sampling designs and calculate dependent variables that can be count data, binary data, or proportions.

A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation. Heatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.;A heatmap is a data visualization tool where numerical values are replaced with colors, making it easier to understand the data.

Many concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer Alhazen (a.k.a. Ibn al-Haytham). Emerging from the mathematics of antiquity and combining this with the generally rising investigation of physics, Alhazen was the first to manipulate experimental conditions in a systematic sense, thereby paving the way towards the scientific method, which would emerge centuries later. Alhazen is also relevant because he could be considered a polymath, highlighting the rise of more knowledge that actually enabled such characters, but still being too far away from the true formation of the diverse canon of scientific disciplines, which would probably have welcomed him as an expert on one matter or the other. Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.;The approach of controlled testing by Arabian mathematician and astronomer Alhazen brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods.

Multivariate data can be principally shown by three ways of graphical representation: ordination plots, cluster diagrams or network plots. Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.;Multivariate data can be represented graphically in three ways: ordination plots, cluster diagrams, and network plots.

Traditionally in the fields of computer science and mathematics, you have some input and some rule in form of a function. You feed the input into the rule and get some output. In this setting, you need to know the rule exactly in order to create a system that gives you the outputs that you need. This works quite well in many situations where the nature of inputs and/or the nature of the outputs is well understood. However, in situations where the inputs can be noisy or the outputs are expected to be different in each case, you cannot hand-craft the rules that account for every type of inputs or for every type of output imaginable. In such a scenario, another powerful approach can be applied: Machine Learning.;In traditional computer science and mathematics, a rule or function is used to process inputs and generate outputs. This works well when inputs and outputs are well understood. However, when inputs are noisy or outputs vary, it's not feasible to create rules for every possible scenario. In these cases, Machine Learning can be used.;What is the advantage of using Machine Learning over traditional rules or functions in computer science and mathematics?;Machine Learning can handle scenarios where inputs are noisy or outputs vary, which is not feasible with traditional rules or functions.
"Machine Learning techniques perform very well - sometimes better than humans- on variety of tasks (eg. detecting cancer from x-ray images, playing chess, art authentication, etc.) In a variety of situations where outcomes are noisy, Machine Learning models perform better than rule-based models. Even though many methods in the field of Machine Learning have been researched quite extensively, the techniques still suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability. Reproducibility crisis is a big problem in the field of Machine Learning research as highlighted in [6]. Machine Learning approaches have been criticized as being a ""brute force"" approach of solving tasks. Machine Learning techniques only perform well when the dataset size is large. With large data sets, training a ML model takes a large computational resources that can be costly in terms of time and money.";Machine learning techniques excel in various tasks, often outperforming humans and rule-based models, especially in noisy situations. However, they suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability, and face a reproducibility crisis.

"We define ''Scientific Methods'' as follows: * First and foremost, scientific methods produce knowledge. * Focussing on the academic perspective, scientific methods can be either '''reproducible''' and '''learnable'''; can be '''documented''' and are '''learnable'''; or are '''reproducible''', can be '''documented''', and are '''learnable'''. * From a systematic perspective, methods are approaches that help us '''gather''' data, '''analyse''' data, and/or '''interpret''' it. Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. * Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature.";Scientific methods are defined as reproducible, learnable, and documentable approaches that produce knowledge and help gather, analyze, and interpret data.

Mindfulness is a concept with diverse facets. In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative assumptions that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the contexts of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.;Mindfulness is a multifaceted concept that aims to clear the mind and focus on the present moment, free from normative assumptions.

The central topic is written into the center of the visualisation (e.g. a whiteboard, with a digital tool, or a large horizontally arranged sheet of paper). This central topic can be see as a city center on a city map, and all relevant information items then are arranged around it like different districts of the city. The information items should focus on the most important terms and data, and omit any unncessary details. These elements may be connected to the central topic through lines, like streets, or branches, resulting in a web structure. Elements may be subordinate to other elements, indicating nestedness of the information. Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections.;In a Mindmap, the central topic is placed in the center of the visualization, with all relevant information arranged around it like districts in a city.

Mixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.;Mixed Effect Models, a continuation of Fisher's work, incorporate both fixed and random factors to minimize the impact of unwanted information on statistical results. Fisher's experiments aimed to control variance within experiments, while acknowledging the influence of underlying factors. Charles Roy Henderson further developed this by creating calculations for linear unbiased estimates, allowing for the testing of complex hypotheses and analysis of complex datasets. This versatility has led to the widespread use of Mixed Effect Models in various disciplines.;Who developed the calculations that allowed for linear unbiased estimates in Mixed Effect Models?;Charles Roy Henderson developed the calculations that allowed for linear unbiased estimates in Mixed Effect Models.
The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are. There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done better by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know.;Mixed Effect Models are highly versatile, capable of handling almost any part of univariate or advanced statistics more effectively than other models. They outperform Analysis of Variance in statistical power and Regressions in handling complex datasets, and their ability to plan and understand random variance brings science closer to distinguishing between what we want to know and what we do not.;How do Mixed Effect Models compare to Analysis of Variance and Regressions in terms of statistical power and handling complex datasets?;Mixed Effect Models surpass Analysis of Variance in terms of statistical power and eclipse Regressions by being better able to handle the complexities of real world datasets.
The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.;A blunt approach to model reduction is a stepwise procedure, which boils down a model until only significant variables remain.

"The simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word ""fairly"" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented.";The simplest approach to identify redundancies is through correlations, specifically Pearson correlation, which doesn't require a normal distribution. Variables with a correlation coefficient above 0.9 are considered redundant, and those between 0.7 and 0.9 are suspicious.

Narrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening. Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006).;Narrative Research or 'Narrative Inquiry' is based on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' as a form of communication used by individuals and communities to make sense of their experiences. Narratives are not just representations of events, but a way of making sense of the world, linking events in meaning.

Over the last decades, many types of statistical models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with Generalised Linear Models. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer causality when explaining the patterns that are being modeled.;In recent decades, various statistical models have been developed to handle non-linear dynamics, with Generalized Additive Models (GAM) being a notable example. Developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, these models can compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion and outperform linear models when predictors follow a non-linear pattern.

Poisson Distribution is one of the discrete probability distributions along with binomial, hypergeometric, and geometric distributions. Poisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.;Poisson Distribution is a discrete probability distribution.

Pomodoro is a method to self-organize, avoid losing yourself, stay productive and energized. Pomodoro is very simple. All you need is work to be done and a timer. There are six steps in the technique: Decide on the task to be done. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes = 1 Pomodoro). Work on the task. End work when the timer rings (Optionally: put a checkmark on a piece of paper). If you have fewer than four checkmarks (i.e. done less than 4 Pomodoros) , take a short break (5 minutes), then go back to step 2. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then start again at step 1.;The Pomodoro technique is a simple method for self-organization and productivity that involves working in timed intervals, taking short breaks after each interval, and taking a longer break after four intervals.;How does the Pomodoro technique work?;The Pomodoro technique works by deciding on a task, setting a timer for 25 minutes, working on the task until the timer rings, taking a short break if fewer than four intervals have been completed, and taking a longer break after four intervals, then resetting the count and starting again.
This term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features / dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem.;The 'curse of dimensionality', a term coined by Richard R. Bellman, refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning. As the number of features increases, data points become sparse and distant, making learning more difficult and error-prone. This also complicates data visualization and interpretation, and increases computational costs. Principal Component Analysis is a solution to this problem.;What is the 'curse of dimensionality'?;The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning, including sparsity of data points, increased difficulty in learning, and complications in data visualization and interpretation.
The following parameters are used: id = final digit of the student matriculation number group = name of the learning group sex = gender in binary categories (m = male, f = female) quanti = number of solved exercises points = total score achieved from the exercises exam = total score achieved from the final written exam (Students must have to participate in the final written exam. If not, they will be considered as fail) passed = dummy whether the person has passed the class or not. Firstly, the aim for analyzing the dataset is to figure out the performance scored among the learning groups and gender for the solved questions, exercises and written exams. Secondly, we want to figure out the correlation between variables and most importantly to figure out heteroscedastic and homoscedastic dispersion, since the OLS is only apt when homoscedasticity is the case.;The dataset includes parameters such as student id, learning group, gender, number of solved exercises, total score from exercises, total score from final exam, and pass status.

"Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell. At the time, corporate planning was traditionally ""(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude."" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the ""Unified Planning Machinery"". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2).";"Scenario Planning was significantly advanced by Shell in response to increasing forecasting errors since the early 1970s.

"Thought Experiments are the philosophical method that asks the ""What if"" questions in a systematic sense. Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word ""experiment"" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.";"Thought Experiments are philosophical methods that systematically ask ""What if"" questions, challenging our world assumptions.

Temporal autocorrelation. This principle defines that we humans value everything that occurs in the close past or future to be more relevant than occurrences in the distant future or past. This is even independent of the likelihood whether future events will actually happen. As an example, imagine that you want to have a new computer every few years, and you can pay 5€ to have a 50% chance to get a new computer tomorrow. If you actually needed one, you would surely do that. However, even adjusted for inflation, many people would not pay the same 5€ to have a 50 % chance to win the latest computer in 10 years. What difference does it make? It is the latest tech in any case. Temporal discounting is one of the main ways how people act unreasonably. This even extends well beyond the point where we are dead already, although this also plays a role. Our unreasonable inabilities to transcend temporal discounting extend likewise into the past. The strongest argument to this end is how many people insist that they are worse off today when compared to the past - in the 'good old days'. The mistake that is typically made is that some aspects in the past were better, while many other aspects were worse. People hence have a tendency to value the time period closer to them different from the time periods more distant. For the past, only the good things are remembered, and for the present, the negative sides are also acknowledged. It widely depends on other circumstances whether this unreasonable evaluation is better or worse than a more objective view on each time period. In any case, the sheer difference between how people evaluate distant time periods or events compared to closer ones is one indirect motivation for science to put this knowledge into perspective.;Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future. This is evident in temporal discounting, where people act unreasonably by valuing the present more than the future or past. This bias extends to how people perceive their current situation compared to the past, often idealizing the past and overlooking its negative aspects.;What is temporal autocorrelation?;Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future.
"The research project ""Besatzfisch"" is a good example of a long-term transdisciplinary research project that engages with different methodological approaches. This four year project attempted to understand the ecological, social and economic role and effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems. First, fish was introduced to ecosystems and the subsequent population dynamics were qualitatively & quantitatively measured, much of this jointly with the cooperating anglers ('Cooperation'). Second, anglers were questioned about fish population sizes and their economic implications ('Consultation') before the data was analyzed using monetary modelling. Third, decision-making processes were modelled based on conversations with anglers, and their mental models about fishing were evaluated ('Consultation'). Fourth, participatory workshops were conducted to help anglers optimize their fishing grounds ('Empowerment'). Fifth, social-ecological models were developed based on the previous empirical results. ('Consultation') Sixth, the project results are published in different forms of media for different target groups ('Information').";The research project Besatzfisch is a transdisciplinary study lasting four years aimed at understanding the role and effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems.
