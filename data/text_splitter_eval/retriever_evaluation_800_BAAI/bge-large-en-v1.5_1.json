First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nKoning, Rembrand, Sharique Hasan, and Aaron Chatterji. \u201cExperimentation and Start-up Performance: Evidence from A\/B Testing.\u201d Management Science 68, no. 9 (September 2022): 6434\u201353. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1287\/mnsc.2021.4209Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nSiroker, Dan, and Pete Koomen.

Edited by Milan Maushart"],"1":["====Analysis of Variance====\n'''The [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/a\/anova.asp ANOVA] is one key analysis tool of [[Experiments|laboratory experiments]]''' - but also other experiments as we shall see later. This statistical test is - mechanically speaking - comparing the means of more than two groups by extending the restriction of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Two_sample_t-test|t-test]]. Comparing different groups became thus a highly important procedure in the design of experiments, which is, apart from laboratories, also highly relevant in greenhouse experiments in ecology, where conditions are kept stable through a controlled environment. \n\nThe general principle of the ANOVA is rooted in [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. An idealized null hypothesis is formulated against which the data is being tested. If the ANOVA gives a significant result, then the null hypothesis is rejected, hence it is statistically unlikely that the data confirms the null hypothesis. As one gets an overall p-value, it can be thus confirmed whether the different groups differ overall. Furthermore, the ANOVA allows for a measure beyond the p-value through the '''sum of squares calculations''' which derive how much is explained by the data, and how large in relation the residual or unexplained information is.\n\n====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes. Since a non-normal distribution may influence the outcome of the test, boxplots are a helpful visual aid, as these allow for a simple detection tool of non-normal distribution levels. \n\nEqually should ideally the variance be comparable across all levels, which is called '''[https:\/\/blog.minitab.com\/blog\/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis\/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia homoscedastic]'''. What is also important is the criteria of '''independence''', meaning that samples of factor levels should not influence each other. For this reason are for instance in ecological experiments plants typically planted in individual pots. In addition does the classical ANOVA assume a '''balanced design''', which means that all factor levels have an equal sample size. If some factor levels have less samples than others, this might pose interactions in terms of normals distribution and variance, but there is another effect at play. Larger sample sizes on one factor level may create a disbalance, where factor levels with larger samples pose a larger influence on the overall model result. \n\n====One way and two way ANOVA====\nSingle factor analysis that are also called '[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nvAMVY2cmok one-way ANOVAs]' investigate one factor variable, and all other variables are kept constant. Depending on the number of factor levels these demand a so called [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latin_square randomisation], which is necessary to compensate for instance for microclimatic differences under lab conditions.\n\nDesigns with multiple factors or '[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/analysis-of-variance-anova-3026693 two way ANOVAs]' test for two or more factors, which then demands to test for interactions as well. This increases the necessary sample size on a multiplicatory scale, and the degrees of freedoms may dramatically increase depending on the number of factors levels and their interactions. An example of such an interaction effect might be an experiment where the effects of different watering levels and different amounts of fertiliser on plant growth are measured. While both increased water levels and higher amounts of fertiliser right increase plant growths slightly, the increase of of both factors jointly might lead to a dramatic increase of plant growth."],"2":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Bayesian approaches incorporate prior information into its analysis. This means that any past information one has can be used in a fruitful way.\n* Bayesian approach provides a more intuitive and direct statement of the probability that the hypothesis is true, as opposed to the frequentist approach where the interpretation of p-value is convoluted.\n\n* Even though the concept is intuitive to understand, the mathematical formulation and definitions can be intimidating for beginners.\n* Identifying correct prior distribution can be very difficult in real life problems which are not based on careful experimental design.\n* Solving complex models with Bayesian approach is still computationally expensive.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. Just like the examples presented above, this has several flipsides of the same coin.\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances. Especially for predictive modeling and small data problems, Bayesian approaches should be preferred, as well as for tough cases that defy the standard array of statistical distributions. Let us hope for a future where we surely know how to toss a coin. For more on this, please refer to the entry on [[Non-equilibrium dynamics]].\n\n== Outlook ==\nBayesian methods have been central in a variety of domains where outcomes are probabilistic in nature; fields such as engineering, medicine, finance, etc. heavily rely on Bayesian methods to make forecasts. Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future."],"3":["'''A third example is the repugnant conclusion.''' Are many quite happy people comparable to few very happy people? This question is widely considered to be a paradox, which is also known as the mere addition problem. We cannot \u2018objectively\u2019 measure happiness, and much less calculate it. What this teaches us is that it is difficult for us to judge whether a life is happy and worth living, even if we personally do not consider it to be this way. People can have fulfilled lives without us understanding this. Here, statistics fail once more, partly because of our normative perspective to interpret the different scenarios. \n\n'''Another example, kindly borrowed from Daniel Dennet, are nuclear disasters.''' In Chernobyl many workers had to work under conditions that were creating a large harm to them, and a great emotional and medical burden. To this date, assumptions about the death toll vary widely. However, without their efforts it would be unclear what would have happened otherwise, as the molten nuclear lava would probably have reached the drainage water, leading to an explosion that might have rendered many parts of Eastern Europe uninhabitable. All these dynamics were hard to anticipate, and even more difficult to balance against the efforts of the workers. Basically, this disaster posed a wicked problem. One must state that these limitations of calculations and the evaluations of outcomes were already stated in Utilitarianism in Moore's Principia Ethics, but this has been widely overseen by many, who still guide their actions through imperfect predictions.\n\n\n== The Trolley problem ==\nOne last example of the relation between ethics and statistics is the problem of inaction. What if you could save 5 people, but you would know that somebody else then dies through the action that saves the other five. Many people prefer not to act. To them, an inaction is ethically more ok than the actual act, which would make them responsible for the death of one person, even if they saved five times as many people. This is also related to knowledge and certainty. Much knowledge exists that should lead people to act, but they prefer to not act at all. Obviously, this is a great challenge, and while psychology investigates this knowledge-action gap, I propose that it will still be here to stay for an unfortunately long time. If people were able to emotionally connect to information derived from numbers, just as the example above, and would be able to act reasonable, much harm could be avoided or at least minimised. This consequentialism is widely missing to date, albeit much of our constructed systems are based on quite similar rules. '''For instance, many people today do in fact understand that their actions have a negative impact on the climate, but nevertheless continue with these actions.''' Hence it is not only an inaction between knowledge and action, but also a gap between constructed systems and individuals. There is much to explore here, and as Martha Nussbaum rightly concluded in the Monarchy of Fear, even under dire political circumstances, \"hope really is both a choice and a practical habit.\" Hence it is not only utilitarianism that links statistics to ethics, but these questions also links to the social contract, and how we act reasonably or unreasonably. Many experimental modifications of the Trolley experiment were investigated by Psychology, and these led to many interpretations on why people act unreasonably. One main result is that humans may tend to minimize the harm they do to others, even if this may create more harm to people on an indirect level. Pushing a lever is a different thing from pushing a person."],"4":["Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework. More on this point later. Let us now begin with a presentation of the diverse ordination types and their respective origins. \n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\nThis ordination is one of the most original ordination techniques, and builds form its underlying mechanics on the principal component analysis. However, since it is based on the chi square test, it is mainly applied for categorical data, although it can also be applied to count data, given that the dataset contains enough statistical power for this. In a nutshell, the correspondence analysis creates orthogonal axis that represent a dimension reduction of the input data, thereby effectively reducing the multivariate categorical data into artificial exes, out of which the first contains the most explanatory power. Typically, the second and third axis contain still meaningful information, yet for most datasets the first two axis may suffice. The correspondence analysis is today mostly negotiable in terms of its direct application, yet serves as an important basis for other approaches, such as the Detrended Correspondence analysis or the Canonical Correspondence analysis. This is also partly related to the largest flaw in the Correspondence analysis, namely the so called Arch-effect, where information on the first two axis is skewed due to mathematical representation of the data. Still, the underlying calculation, mainly the reciprocal averaging approach make it stand out as a powerful tool to sort large multivariate datasets based on categorical or count data. Consequently, the basic reciprocal averaging was initially very relevant for scientific disciplines such as ecology and psychology. \n\n=== Detrended Correspondence analysis ==="],"5":["[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.'''

Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician."],"6":["[[File:ConceptClusteringMethods.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Cohort Study]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || [[:Category:Future|Future]]\n|}\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n'''In short:''' Clustering is a method of data analysis through the grouping of unlabeled data based on certain metrics.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Clustering SCOPUS.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits for Clustering until 2019.'''

Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as ''similarity measure'' or ''distance measure'', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named \"unsupervised learning\", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term \"clustering\" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.\n\n== Data Simulation ==\nThis article deals with simulated data. This section contains the function used to simulate the data. For the purpose of this article, the data has three clusters. You need to load the function on your R environment in order to simulate the data and perform clustering."],"7":["* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape.\nImportantly, the actual distance between nodes is thus not equatable with the physical distance in a [[Glossary|visualisation]]. Sometimes, nodes that are visually very close to each other are actually very far away. The actual distance between elements of the network should be measured based on the \"number of lines which it is necessary to traverse in order to get from one point to another.\" (Scott 1988, p.114)\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Network Types.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Different network structures.'''

The data must convey a message to the receiver and be durable (2, 3). Often, Content Analysis focuses on data that are difficult or impossible to interpret with other methods (3). The data may exist 'naturally' and be publicly available, for example verbal discourse, written documents, or visual representations from mass media (newspapers, books, films, comics etc.); or be rather unavailable to the public, such as personal letters or witness accounts. The data may also be generated for the research purpose (e.g. interview transcripts) (1, 2, 4).  \n\nWhile there is a wide range of qualitative Content Analysis approaches, this entry will focus on joint characteristics of these. For more information on the different variations, please refer to Schreier (2014) in the Key Publications."],"12":["Correlations can be applied to all kinds of quantitative continuous data from all spatial and temporal scales, from diverse methodological origins including [[Survey]]s and Census data, ecological measurements, economical measurements, GIS and more. Correlations are also used in both inductive and deductive approaches. This versatility makes correlation analysis one of the most frequently used quantitative methods to date.\n\n'''There are different forms of correlation analysis.''' The Pearson correlation is usually applied to normally distributed data, or more precisely, data that shows a [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/students-t-distribution\/ Student's t-distribution]. Alternative correlation measures like [https:\/\/www.statisticssolutions.com\/kendalls-tau-and-spearmans-rank-correlation-coefficient\/ Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho] are usually applied to variables that are not normally distributed. I recommend you just look them up, and keep as a rule of thumb that Spearman's rho is the most robust correlation measure when it comes to non-normally distributed data.\n\n==== Calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient r ====\nThe formula to calculate [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2B_UW-RweSE a Pearson correlation coefficient] is fairly simple. You just need to keep in mind that you have two variables or samples, called x and y, and their respective means (m). \n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-02 um 09.46.54.png|400px|center|thumb|This is the formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient r.]]\n<br\/>\n\n=== Conducting and reading correlations ===\nThere are some core questions related to the application and reading of correlations. These can be of interest whenever you have the correlation coefficient at hand - for example, in a statistical software - or when you see a correlation plot.<br\/>\n\n'''1) Is the relationship between two variables positive or negative?''' If one variable increases, and the other one increases, too, we have  a positive (\"+\") correlation. This is also true if both variables decrease. For instance, being taller leads to a significant increase in\u00a0[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3534609\/ body weight]. On the other hand, if one variable increases, and the other decreases, the correlation is negative (\"-\"): for example, the relationship between 'pizza eaten' and 'pizza left' is negative. The more pizza slices are eaten, the fewer slices are still there. This direction of the relationship tells you a lot about how two variables might be logically connected. The normative value of a positive or negative relation typically has strong implications, especially if both directions are theoretically possible. Therefore it is vital to be able to interpret the direction of a correlative relationship. \n\n'''2) Is the correlation coefficient small or large?''' It can range from -1 to +1, and is an important measure when we evaluate the strength of a statistical relationship. Data points may scatter widely in a [[Correlation_Plots#Scatter_Plot|scatter plot,]] or there may be a rather linear relationship - and everything in between. An example for a perfect positive correlation (with a correlation coefficient ''r'' of +1) is the relationship between temperature in [[To_Rule_And_To_Measure#Celsius_vs_Fahrenheit_vs_Kelvin|Celsius and Fahrenheit]]. This should not be surprising, since Fahrenheit is defined as 32 + 1.8\u00b0 C. Therefore, their relationship is perfectly linear, which results in such a strong correlation coefficient. We can thus say that 100% of the variation in temperature in Fahrenheit is explained by the temperature in Celsius."],"13":["<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\">\n# Fig.4\n# get the data\neu_stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets)\n\n# Plot a basic line chart\nplot(eu_stocks$DAX, # select the data\n     type='l',      # choose 'l' for line chart\n     col='blue',    # choose the color of the line\n     lwd = 2,       # choose the line width \n     main = 'Line Chart of DAX Index (1991-1998)',         # title of the plot\n     xlab = 'Time (1991 to 1998)', ylab = 'Prices in EUR') # x- and y-axis labels\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nYou can see that this plot looks much more informative and attractive.\n\n\n== Correlogram ==\n=== Definition ===\nThe correlogram visualizes the calculated correlation coefficients for more than two variables.

To create such a correlogram, you need to install the R package <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>corrplot<\/syntaxhighlight> and import the library.

Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic where many other leisure activities were not available due to restrictions, many people turned to outdoor activities such as bird watching. \n\nThis trend in citizen participation is supported by technical development making bird identification easier through the usage of identification apps. Smartphone apps such as \u201ceBirds\u201d help to identify species and also upload photos and the location where the individual was observed. This leads to a growing global online-community of bird watchers who create new data points in observation databases that scientists and environmentalists can make use of for conservation research or planning. For instance, in Canada, the number of people submitting photos to eBirds increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020 (8).\n\nBecause many bird watchers are novices, bird identification is not always carried out correctly. This is a general problem of citizen science. In the case of eBirds, bird experts volunteer as reviewers who check photos for correct determination, especially in the case of rare species that are uncommon in a certain area. This increases the quality of the data (8). However, a study conducted in the UK has shown that citizen science data may be reliable only for widespread and common species, even with many data points and a good coverage of the area (9). \n\nScientists hope that [[Citizen_Science|citizen science]] data may fill data gaps, for instance in the tropics. However, comparisons to data from Bird Life International have shown that the bird abundances for rare species in the tropics are strongly over-estimated. A likely reason is that bird observers are very determined to find these rare species and thereby overlook or under-record more common species and focus on rare ones (10). \nNevertheless, as technology progresses, identification apps are becoming better and easier to use. Moreover, scientists are working on new approaches to include such data into their research in meaningful ways. This trend of increasing citizen participation is thus likely to continue.\n\nTelemetry is another method that was further developed in recent years, although it has been used already for decades in wildlife ecology. Telemetry is \u201cthe system of determining information about an animal through the use of radio signals from or to a device carried by the animal\u201d (11). For birds, this method can be applied in areas ranging in size from restricted breeding territories of resident bird species to movement patterns of international migratory species. Also, the distribution patterns of infectious diseases of migratory species can be tracked (11). However, for some birds, negative effects on nesting behavior were observed (12). \n\n== Key publications ==\n=== Theoretical ===\n\nFuller, R. J., & Langslow, D. R. (1984).

To this day, such a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem remains a reason to choose Delphi. Delphi may also be an appropriate choice if the collective subjective judgment by the experts is beneficial to the problem-solving process (2, 4, 5, 6).\n* Delphi can be used as a form of group counseling when other forms, such as face-to-face interactions between multiple stakeholders, are not feasible or even detrimental to the process due to counterproductive group dynamics (4, 5).\n* The value of the Delphi method is that it reveals clearly those ideas that are the reason for disagreements between stakeholders, and those that are consensual (5).\n* Delphi can be \"(...) a highly motivating experience for participants\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309) due to the feedback on the group's opinions that is provided in subsequent questioning stages.\n* The Delphi method with its feedback characteristic has advantages over direct confrontation of the experts, which \"(...) all too often induces the hasty formulation of preconceived notions, an inclination to close one's mind to novel ideas, a tendency to defend a stand once taken, or, alternatively and sometimes alternately, a predisposition to be swayed by persuasively stated opinions of others.\" (Okoli & Pawlowski 2004, p.2, after Dalkey & Helmer)\n* Additionally, Delphi provides several advantages over traditional surveys:\n** Studies have shown that averages of group responses are superior to averages of individual responses.

Further, they comment that integrated research modes demand new methods and concepts, new institutional arrangements, organizational [[Glossary|competencies]] and tailored funding possibilities.

Also, the authors highlight that there may be inertia to change in the given system which needs to be overcome.\n* Lang et al.

These projects meet complex problems with complex responses, entailing the need to remain flexible and responsive to participant requirements and the need to modify the approach if new information and values arise.\" They highlight communicative challenges especially in the framing of problems (exclusion of important perspectives, different views of the problem) and the conduction of the research (unwillingness to share personal perspectives, failure to recognize or articulate differences in individual assumptions, uncertainties and incomplete or incompatible knowledge, limited cognitive abilities to integrated individual partial knowledge).\n\n==== Methods of transdisciplinary research ====\nSeveral scientific methods are useful for transdisciplinary work.

However, coming back to bias, the answer to an almost universal rejection of empiricism will [[Big problems for later|not be followed here]]. Instead, we need to come back to the three foundational theories of philosophy, and need to acknowledge that reason, social contract and utilitarianism are the foundation of the first empirical disciplines that are at their core normative (e.g. psychology, social and political science, and economics). Since bias can be partly related to these three theories, and consequentially to specific empirical disciplines, we need to recognise that there is an overarching methodological bias. This methodological bias has a signature rooted in specific design criteria, which are in turn related to specific disciplines. Consequently, this methodological bias is a disciplinary bias - even more so, since methods may be shared among scientific disciplines, but most disciplines claim either priority or superiority when it comes to the ownership of a method.\n\nThe disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.\n\nSoft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a 'system' an \"(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world\" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a 'system'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking''' according to Checkland.

It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). ''System Analysis'', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below.

This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# '''Select the topic you want to learn more about.''' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don't go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain \"Economics\" or \"Physics\" in one go.\n# '''Find someone to talk to'''. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don't have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# '''Make notes.''' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and\/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# '''Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.''' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it. Congratulations!"],"22":["==Fixed effects vs. Random effects==\n[[File:Smoking trooper.jpg|thumb|right|If smoking is a fixed or a random effect depends on the study design]]\nWithin [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical standpoint the value of such pre-tests may be limited at best."],"23":["==Replication of experiments==\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 17.10.27.png|thumb|One famous example from the discipline of psychology is the Milgram shock experiment carried out by Stanley Milgram a professor from the Yale University in 1963.]]\nField experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments.

Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician."],"26":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Heatmaps. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting.

All this triggered not only an enormous cultural change, but more importantly an increasing exchange, leading to schools of thoughts that became increasingly connected through writing, and also often in thinking. '''Logic is an example of a branch of philosophy that linked the ancients (Plato, Confucius, [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/buddha\/ Buddha]) with the philosophy of the enlightenment.'''

This is insofar highly relevant for methods, because it can be argued that the surplus from the colonies and distant countries was one of the main drivers of the thriving of the European colonial rulers, their economies and consequently, their science. A direct link can be made between the [[Normativity of Methods|inequalities]] that were increased by colonialism and the thriving of Western science, including the development of scientific methods."],"28":["Simple '''pie charts''' are not really ideal, as they camouflage the real proportions of the data they show.

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.\n\nAlso, each scientific method that is described on this Wiki is categorized according to the Wiki's underlying [[Design Criteria of Methods]].<br\/>\n'''This means that each method fulfills one or more categories of each of the following criteria:'''\n<br\/>\n* [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] - [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n* [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] - [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n* Spatial scales: [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] - [[:Category:System|System]] - [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n* Temporal scales: [[:Category:Past|Past]] - [[:Category:Present|Present]] - [[:Category:Future|Future]]\nYou can click on each category for more information and all the entries that belong to this category.\n<br\/>\n\n\n=== Which methods can you learn about? ===\nSee all methods that have been described on this Wiki so far:\n<categorytree mode=\"pages\" hideroot=\"on\">Methods<\/categorytree>\n<br>\nWe also have what we call '''Level 2''' overview pages. <br>\nOn these pages, we present everything that is necessary for a specific field of methods in a holistic way.

The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|'''MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters\/bubbles, as in this example.''' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols.

It allows for a quick overview of all relevant information items on a topic at a glance. It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings. A Mindmap can also be a good tool for a [[Glossary|brainstorming]] process, since it does not focus too much on the exact relationships between the visualised elements, but revolves around a more intuitive approach of arranging information.\n\nThe central topic is written into the center of the [[Glossary|visualisation]] (e.g. a whiteboard, with a digital tool, or a large horizontally arranged sheet of paper). '''This central topic can be see as a city center on a city map, and all relevant information items then are arranged around it like different districts of the city.''' The information items should focus on the most important terms and data, and omit any unncessary details. These elements may be connected to the central topic through lines, like streets, or branches, resulting in a web structure. '''Elements may be subordinate to other elements, indicating nestedness of the information.''' Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections."],"34":["[[File:ConceptMixedEffectModels.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Mixed Effect Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"|''' [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n\n'''In short:''' Mixed Effect Models are stastistical approaches that contain both fixed and random effects, i.e. models that analyse linear relations while decreasing the variance of other factors.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Mixed Effects Model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Mixed Effects Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: '''Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and\/or continuous]] independent variables'''. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs."],"35":["Often, these models serve as a baseline for the whole scheme of analysis, and thus already help researchers to design and plan their whole data campaign. Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many studies in medicine that investigate how a certain drug works on people to cure a disease. To this end, you want to know the effect the drug has on the prognosis of the patients. What you do not want to know is whether people are worse off if they are older, have a lack of exercise or an unhealthy diet. All these single effects do not matter for you, because it is well known that the prognosis often gets worse with higher age, and factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet choices. What you may want to know, is whether the drug works better or worse in people that have unhealthy diet choice, are older or lack regular exercise. These interaction can be meaningfully investigated by Mixed Effect Models. '''All positive factors' variance is minimised, while the effect of the drug as well as its interactions with the other factors can be tested.''' This makes Mixed Effect Models so powerful, as you can implement them in a way that allows to investigate quite complex hypotheses or questions.\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of Mixed Effect Models is the level of experience that is necessary to implement them in a meaningful way. Designing studies takes a lot of experience, and the current form of peer-review does often not allow to present the complex thinking that goes into the design of advanced studies (Paper BEF China design). There is hence a discrepancy in how people implement studies, and how other researchers can understand and emulate these approaches. Mixed Effect Models are also an example where textbook knowledge is not saturated yet, hence books are rather quickly outdated, and also often do not offer exhausting examples to real life problems researchers may face when designing studies. Medicine and psychology are offering growing resources to this end, since here the preregistration of studies due to the reproducibility crisis offers a glimpse in the design of scientific studies."],"36":["== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are."],"37":["Instead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis."],"38":["'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.\n\nNarrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006)."],"39":["== The chaos increases ==\nThis brings us now to the second point: what are current models that try to take non-equilibrium dynamics into account? The most simple models are [[Correlations]] and [[Regression Analysis|Regressions]], with 'time' as the independent variable in the case of regressions, or just look at simple temporal correlations concerning temporal dynamics. Since such models either build on linear dynamics of blunt rank statistics, it is clear that such approaches must fail when it comes to taking non-linear dynamics into account. '''Non-equilibrium dynamics are more often than not characterised by non-linear patterns, which need us to step out of the world of linear dynamics.''' \n\nOver the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the patterns that are being modeled. '''In other words, GAMs are able to increase the model fit or predictive power, but in the worst case, we are throwing our means to understand or explain the existing relations out of the window.''' \n\nUnder this spell, over the last decades, parts of the statistical modelling wandered more strongly into the muddy waters of superior model fit, yet understood less and less about the underlying mechanisms. Modern science has to date not sufficiently engaged with the questions how predictive modelling can lead to optimific results, and which role our lack of explicit understanding play in terms of worse outcomes. Preventing a pandemic based on a predictive model is surely good, but enforcing a space shuttle start when there is some lack of understanding of the new conditions at launch day led to the Challenger disaster. '''Many disasters of human history were a lack of understanding the unexpected.''' When our experience was pushed into the new realms of the previously unknown, and our expactation of the likelihood of such an extreme event happening was low, the impending surprise often came at a high price. Many developments - global change, increasing system [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity,]] growing inequalities - may further decrease our ability to anticipate infrequent dynamics. This calls for a shift towards maximizing the resilience of our models that may be needed under future circumstances. While this has been highlighted i.e. by the IPCC, the Stockholm resilience center and many other institutions, policy makers are hardly prepared enough, which became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n== The world can (not) be predicted ==\nFrom a predictive or explanatory viewpoint, we can break the world of statistics down into three basic types of dynamics: Linear dynamics, periodical dynamics, and non-linear dynamics. Let us differentiate between these three."],"40":["Poisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance. For more real-life examples of Poisson distribution in practice, visit [https:\/\/studiousguy.com\/poisson-distribution-examples\/ this page].\n\n==3. Calculation and Probability Mass Function (PMF) Graph==\n\n===Probability Mass Function Graph===\n\n''The Poisson distribution probability mass function (pmf) gives the probability of observing k events in a period given the length of the period and the average events per time.''\n\n[[File:1 equation.PNG|center|250px]]\nT = Time interval \ne = natural logarithmic base \nk = number of events \nThe K! means K factorial. This means that we multiply all integers from K down to 1. Say K is 4 then K!= 4* 3* 2* 1= 24\n\nIntroducing lambda, \u03bb, as a rate parameter (events\/time)*T into the equation gives us \n[[File:2 equation.PNG|center]]\n\nSo, \u03bb is basically the expected number of event occurrences in an interval, a function of '''number of events''' and the '''time interval'''. Changing \u03bb means changing the probability of event occurrence in one interval.\n\nFor example, Ladislaus Bortkiewicz calculated the deaths of soldiers by horse kicks in the Prussian Army using Poisson Distribution in the late 1800s. He analyzed two decades of data from up to 10 army corps, equivalent to two centuries of observations for one army corps.\n[[File:Horse.png|center|500px]]\nFigure 1: Poisson Distribution for deaths by horse kick by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz.

However, the deaths were random, for example, in one year four soldiers died and for most years no deaths were caused by horses. Figure 1 shows the probability mass function graph.\nIn Poisson Distribution terms,\n* Death caused by a horse kick is an \u2018event\u2019\n* Mean per time interval, represented by \u03bb, is 0.61\n* The number of deaths by horse kick in a specific year is k.\n\n[[File:Pmf.png|center|500px]]\nFigure 2 is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution and shows the probability (y-axis) of a number of events (x-axis) occurring in one interval with different rate parameters. You can see the most likely number of event occurrences for a graph is equivalent to its rate parameter (\u03bb) as it is the expected number of events in one interval when it is an integer. When it is not an integer, the number of events with the highest probability would be nearest to \u03bb. The Lamda, \u03bb, also represents the mean and variance of the distribution.\n\n==4. Features and Properties==\nSome properties of Poisson distribution are:\n\n1.

Even if we only plot the eigenvectors scaled by their eigenvalues, we will basically have a summary data (and its spreading). At this point, the eigenpairs are be viewed as the principle components of the data.\n\n[[File: PCAEigenvector02.png|center|500px]]\n\n==== Ranking the principle components ====\nAs you may have noticed, the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. This is no coincidence. You can think of it this way: because we want to maximize the variance explained by each of the principle components, these components need to be independent from one another, therefore their orthogonality.  Thus, to define a set of principle components, you find the direction which can explain the variability in the data the most: that is your first principle component (the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue). The second principle compent will be percepdicular to the first, and explain most of what is left of the variability. This continues until the d-th principle component is found.\n\nBy doing so, you are also sorting the \"importance\" of the principle components in terms of the information amount it contains what is used to explain the data. To be clear, the sum of all eigenvalues is the total variability in the data. From here, you can choose to discard any PCs whose percentage of explained variances are low. In many cases, if around 80% of the variance can be explained by the first k PCs, we can discard the other (d - k) PCs. Of course, this is only one of the heuristics method to determine k.  You can also use thr elbow method (the scree plot) like in k-means.\n\n==== Summary ====\n* PCA is a feature extraction technique widely used to reduce dimensionality of datasets.\n* PCA works by calculating the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the initial variables in the data. These are the principle components. Number of PCs = number of eigenvectors = number of features.\n* The PCs are ranked by the eigenvalues, and iteratively show the directions in which the data spreads the most (after accounting for the previous PCs).\n* We can choose to keep a few of the first PCs that cummulatively explains the data well enough, and these are the new reduced dimension of the data.\n* Standardization is a crucial step in data pre-processing to ensure the validity of the PCA results.\n\n\n=== R Example ===\nGoing back to the example in the introduction, the dataset can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sdhilip\/nutrient-analysis-of-pizzas\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For pre-processing data\nlibrary(factoextra) # For visualization\ntheme_set(theme_bw()) # Set theme for plots\n\n# Load data\ndata <- read_csv(\"Pizza.csv\")\nhead(data)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nAs shown here, there are seven measurements of nutrients for each pizza.

Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.'''

A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word \"experiment\" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.  \n\nThe easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a \"What if\" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers of variations of this experiment exist (see Further Information), as it can teach much about choice, ethics, and responsibility. For instance, many people would change the train direction, but hardly anyone would push a person onto the track to derail the train. This would save the other five, and the outcome would be the same. However the difference between pushing a lever or pushing a person has deep psychological ramifications that resolve around guilt. This exemplifies that the Thought Experiment does not necessarily have a ''best'' outcome, as the outcome depends - in this example - on your moral choices. Some might argue that you should hurl yourself onto the track to stop the train, thereby not changing the countable outcome, but performing a deeply altruistic act that saves everybody else. Most people would probably be unable to do this. \n\n'''Such deeply normative Thought Experiments differ from Thought Experiments that resolve around the natural world.''' Dropping a feather and a stone from a high building is such an example, as this experiment is clearly not normative. We are all aware that the air would prevent the feather to fall as fast as the stone. What if we take the air now out of the experiment, and let both fall in a vacuum. Such a Thought Experiment is prominent in physics and exemplifies the great flexibility of this method. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat was another example of the Thought Experiment, where quantum states and uncertainty are illustrated by a cat that is either dead or not, which depends on the decay of some radioactive element. Since radioactive decay rates are not continuous, but represent a sudden change, the cat could be dead or not. The cat is dead and not dead at the same time. Many argue that this is a paradox, and I would follow this assumption with the supporting argument that we basically look at two realities at the same time. This exemplifies again that our interpretation of this Thought Experiment can also be normative, since a definitive proof of my interpretation is very difficult. This is insofar relevant, as seemingly all Thought Experiments are still based on subjective realisations and inferences. \n\n[[File:Schr\u00f6dingers Cat.png|400px|thumb|left|'''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.'''
