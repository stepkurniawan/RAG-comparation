First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nKoning, Rembrand, Sharique Hasan, and Aaron Chatterji. \u201cExperimentation and Start-up Performance: Evidence from A\/B Testing.\u201d Management Science 68, no. 9 (September 2022): 6434\u201353. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1287\/mnsc.2021.4209Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nSiroker, Dan, and Pete Koomen.

Edited by Milan Maushart","'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==A\/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA\/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content. This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A\/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A\/B tests, the scheme of [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|scientific experiments]] is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.\n\n==Planning Phase==\nDuring the planning phase, a goal and hypothesis are formulated, and a study design is developed that specifies the sample size, the duration of the study, and the metrics to be measured. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of the test.\n\n===Goal Definition===\nThe goal identifies problems or optimization potential to improve the software product. For example, in the case of a website, the goal could be to increase newsletter subscriptions or improve the conversion rate through changing parts of the website.\n\n===Hypotheses Formulation===\nTo determine if a particular change is better than the default version, a two-sample hypothesis test is conducted to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the two samples (version A and B). This involves stating the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n\nFrom the perspective of an A\/B test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the control and treatment group, while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the two groups which is influenced by a non-random cause.\n\nIn most cases, it is not known a priori whether the discrepancy in the results between A and B is in favor of A or B. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis should consider the possibility that both versions A and B have different levels of efficiency. In order to account for this, a two-sided test is typically preferred for the subsequent evaluation.\n\n'''For example:'''\n\n\"To fix the problem that there are hardly any subscriptions for my newsletter, I will put the sign-up box higher up on the website.\"\n\nGoal: Increase the newsletter subscriptions on the website.\n\nH0: There are no significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\nH1: There are significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\n===Minimizing Confounding Variables===\nIn order to obtain accurate results, it is important to minimize confounding variables before the A\/B test is conducted. This involves determining an appropriate sample size, tracking the right users, collecting the right metrics, and ensuring that the randomization unit is adequate.","===Minimizing Confounding Variables===\nIn order to obtain accurate results, it is important to minimize confounding variables before the A\/B test is conducted. This involves determining an appropriate sample size, tracking the right users, collecting the right metrics, and ensuring that the randomization unit is adequate.\n\nThe sample size is determined by the percentage of users included in the test variants (control and treatment) and the duration of the experiment. As the experiment runs for a longer period of time, more visitors are exposed to the variants, resulting in an increase in the sample size. Because many external factors vary over time, it is important to randomize over time by running the control and treatment variants simultaneously at a fixed percentage throughout the experiment. Thereby the goal is to obtain adequate statistical power, where the statistical power of an experiment is the probability of detecting a particular effect if it exists. In practice, one can assign any percentages to the control and treatment, but 50% gives the experiment maximum statistical power.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to analyze only the subset of the population\/users that were potentially affected. For example, in an A\/B test aimed at optimizing newsletter subscriptions, it would be appropriate to exclude individuals who were already subscribed to the newsletter, as they would not have been affected by the changes made to the subscription form.\n\nAdditionally, the metrics used in the experiment should be carefully chosen based on their relevance to the hypotheses being tested. For example, in the case of an e-commerce site, metrics such as newsletter subscriptions and revenue per user may be of interest, as they are directly related to the goal of the test. However, it is important to avoid considering too many metrics at once, as this can increase the risk of miscorrelation.\n\n==Execution Phase==\nThe execution phase involves implementing the study design, collecting data, and monitoring the study to ensure it is conducted according to the plan. During this phase, users are randomly assigned to the control or treatment group ensuring that the study is conducted in a controlled and unbiased manner.\n\n==Evaluation Phase==\nThe evaluation phase involves analyzing the data collected during the study and interpreting the results. This phase is crucial for determining the statistical significance of the results and drawing valid conclusions about whether there was a statistical significant difference between the treatment group and the control group. One commonly used method is calculating the [[Designing_studies#P-value|p-value]] of the statistical test, or by using [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes' theorem] calculating the probability that the treatment had a positive effect based on the observed data and the prior beliefs about the treatment.\n\nDepending on the type of data being collected different [[Simple Statistical Tests|statistical tests]] should be considered. For example, when dealing with discrete metrics such as click-through rate, the [https:\/\/mathworld.wolfram.com\/FishersExactTest.html Fisher exact test] can be used to calculate the exact p-value, while the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug chi-squared test] may be more appropriate for larger sample sizes.\n\nIn the case of continuous metrics, such as average revenue per user, the [[T-Test|t-test or Welch's t-test]] may be used to determine the significance of the treatment effect. However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https:\/\/data.library.virginia.edu\/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test\/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate."],"1":["====Analysis of Variance====\n'''The [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/a\/anova.asp ANOVA] is one key analysis tool of [[Experiments|laboratory experiments]]''' - but also other experiments as we shall see later. This statistical test is - mechanically speaking - comparing the means of more than two groups by extending the restriction of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Two_sample_t-test|t-test]]. Comparing different groups became thus a highly important procedure in the design of experiments, which is, apart from laboratories, also highly relevant in greenhouse experiments in ecology, where conditions are kept stable through a controlled environment. \n\nThe general principle of the ANOVA is rooted in [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. An idealized null hypothesis is formulated against which the data is being tested. If the ANOVA gives a significant result, then the null hypothesis is rejected, hence it is statistically unlikely that the data confirms the null hypothesis. As one gets an overall p-value, it can be thus confirmed whether the different groups differ overall. Furthermore, the ANOVA allows for a measure beyond the p-value through the '''sum of squares calculations''' which derive how much is explained by the data, and how large in relation the residual or unexplained information is.\n\n====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes. Since a non-normal distribution may influence the outcome of the test, boxplots are a helpful visual aid, as these allow for a simple detection tool of non-normal distribution levels. \n\nEqually should ideally the variance be comparable across all levels, which is called '''[https:\/\/blog.minitab.com\/blog\/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis\/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia homoscedastic]'''. What is also important is the criteria of '''independence''', meaning that samples of factor levels should not influence each other. For this reason are for instance in ecological experiments plants typically planted in individual pots. In addition does the classical ANOVA assume a '''balanced design''', which means that all factor levels have an equal sample size. If some factor levels have less samples than others, this might pose interactions in terms of normals distribution and variance, but there is another effect at play. Larger sample sizes on one factor level may create a disbalance, where factor levels with larger samples pose a larger influence on the overall model result. \n\n====One way and two way ANOVA====\nSingle factor analysis that are also called '[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nvAMVY2cmok one-way ANOVAs]' investigate one factor variable, and all other variables are kept constant. Depending on the number of factor levels these demand a so called [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latin_square randomisation], which is necessary to compensate for instance for microclimatic differences under lab conditions.\n\nDesigns with multiple factors or '[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/analysis-of-variance-anova-3026693 two way ANOVAs]' test for two or more factors, which then demands to test for interactions as well. This increases the necessary sample size on a multiplicatory scale, and the degrees of freedoms may dramatically increase depending on the number of factors levels and their interactions. An example of such an interaction effect might be an experiment where the effects of different watering levels and different amounts of fertiliser on plant growth are measured. While both increased water levels and higher amounts of fertiliser right increase plant growths slightly, the increase of of both factors jointly might lead to a dramatic increase of plant growth.","Consequently, building on the previous development of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#One_sample_t-test|t-test]], Fisher proposed the Analysis of Variance, abbreviated as ANOVA (Rucci & Tweney 1980). '''It allowed for the comparison of variables from experimental settings, comparing how a [[Data_formats#Continuous_data|continuous]] variable fared under different experimental settings.''' Doing experiments in the laboratory reached its limits, as plant growth experiments were hard to conduct in the small confined spaces of a laboratory. It also became questionable whether the results were actually applicable in the real world. Hence experiments literally shifted into fields, with a dramatic effect on their design, conduct and outcome. While laboratory conditions aimed to minimise variance - ideally conducting experiments with a high confidence -, the new field experiments increased sample size to tame the variability - or messiness - of factors that could not be controlled, such as subtle changes in the soil or microclimate. Fisher and his ANOVA became the forefront of a new development of scientifically designed experiments, which allowed for a systematic [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|testing of hypotheses]] under field conditions, taming variance through replicates. '''The power of repeated samples allowed to account for the variance under field conditions, and thus compare differences in [[Descriptive_statistics|mean]] values between different treatments.''' For instance, it became possible to compare different levels of fertiliser to optimise plant growth. \n\nEstablishing the field experiment became thus a step in the scientific development, but also in the industrial capabilities associated to it. Science contributed directly to the efficiency of production, for better or worse. Equally, the systematic experiments translated into other domains of science, such as psychology and medicine. \n\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe ANOVA is a deductive statistical method that allows to compare how a continuous variable differs under different treatments in a designed experiment. '''It is one of the most important statistical models, and allows for an analysis of data gathered from designed experiments.''' In an ANOVA-designed experiment, several categories are thus compared in terms of their mean value regarding a continuous variable. A classical example would be how a certain type of barley grows on different soil types, with the three soil types loamy, sandy and clay (Crawley 2007, p. 449). If the majority of the data from one soil type differs from the majority of the data from the other soil type, then these two types differ, which can be tested by a t-test. The ANOVA is in principle comparable to the t-test, but extends it: it can compare more than two groups, hence allowing to compare data in more complex, designed experiments.\n\n[[File:Yield.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Does the soil influence the yield?

Source: own.]]\nWith a rise in knowledge during the [[History of Methods|Enlightenment]], it became apparent that the controlled setting of a [[Experiments|laboratory]] were not enough for experiments, as it became obvious that more knowledge was there to be discovered in the [[Field experiments|real world]]. First in astronomy, but then also in agriculture and other fields, the notion became apparent that our reproducible settings may sometimes be hard to achieve within real world settings. Observations can be unreliable, and errors in measurements in astronomy was a prevalent problem in the 18th and 19th century. Fisher equally recognised the mess - or variance - that nature forces onto a systematic experimenter (Rucci & Tweney 1980). The demand for more food due to the rise in population, and the availability of potent seed varieties and fertiliser - both made possible thanks to scientific experimentation - raised the question how to conduct experiments under field conditions."],"2":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Bayesian approaches incorporate prior information into its analysis. This means that any past information one has can be used in a fruitful way.\n* Bayesian approach provides a more intuitive and direct statement of the probability that the hypothesis is true, as opposed to the frequentist approach where the interpretation of p-value is convoluted.\n\n* Even though the concept is intuitive to understand, the mathematical formulation and definitions can be intimidating for beginners.\n* Identifying correct prior distribution can be very difficult in real life problems which are not based on careful experimental design.\n* Solving complex models with Bayesian approach is still computationally expensive.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. Just like the examples presented above, this has several flipsides of the same coin.\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why.

Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future.","This does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why.

Search terms: 'Bayesian' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n'''The basic principles behind Bayesian methods can be attributed to the probability theorist and philosopher, Thomas Bayes.''' His method was published posthumously by Richard Price in 1763. While at the time, the approach did not gain that much attention, it was also rediscovered and extended upon independently by Pierre Simon Laplace (1). Bayes' name only became associated with the method in the 1900s (3).\n\n'''The family of methods based on the concept of Bayesian analysis has risen the last 50 years''' alongside the increasing computing power and the availability of computers to more people, enabling the technical precondition for these calculation-intense approaches. Today, Bayesian methods are applied in a various and diverse parts of the scientific landscape, and are included in such diverse approaches as image processing, spam filtration, document classification, signal estimation, simulation, etc. (2, 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''Bayesian analysis relies on using probability figures as an expression of our beliefs about events.''' Consequently, assigning probability figures to represent our ignorance about events is perfectly valid in Bayesian approach. The probabilities, hence, depend on the current knowledge we have on the event that we are setting our belief on; the initial belief is known is \"prior\", and the probability figure assigned to the prior is called \"prior probability\". Initially, these probabilities are essentially subjective, as these priors are not the properties of a larger sample. However, the probability figure is updated as we receive more data. The final probabilities that we get after applying the Bayesian analysis, called \"posterior probability\", is based on our prior beliefs about the [[Glossary|hypothesis]], and the evidence that we collect:\n\n[[File:Bayesian Inference - Prior and posterior beliefs.png|450px|thumb|center|'''The probability distribution for prior, evidence, and posterior.''']]\n\nSo, how do we update the probability, and hence our belief about the event, as we receive new information? This is achieved using Bayes' Theorem.\n\n==== Bayes' Theorem ====\nBayes theorem provides a formal mechanism for updating our beliefs about an event based on new data. However, we need to establish some definitions before being able to understand and use Bayes' theorem."],"3":["'''A third example is the repugnant conclusion.''' Are many quite happy people comparable to few very happy people? This question is widely considered to be a paradox, which is also known as the mere addition problem. We cannot \u2018objectively\u2019 measure happiness, and much less calculate it. What this teaches us is that it is difficult for us to judge whether a life is happy and worth living, even if we personally do not consider it to be this way. People can have fulfilled lives without us understanding this. Here, statistics fail once more, partly because of our normative perspective to interpret the different scenarios. \n\n'''Another example, kindly borrowed from Daniel Dennet, are nuclear disasters.''' In Chernobyl many workers had to work under conditions that were creating a large harm to them, and a great emotional and medical burden. To this date, assumptions about the death toll vary widely. However, without their efforts it would be unclear what would have happened otherwise, as the molten nuclear lava would probably have reached the drainage water, leading to an explosion that might have rendered many parts of Eastern Europe uninhabitable. All these dynamics were hard to anticipate, and even more difficult to balance against the efforts of the workers. Basically, this disaster posed a wicked problem. One must state that these limitations of calculations and the evaluations of outcomes were already stated in Utilitarianism in Moore's Principia Ethics, but this has been widely overseen by many, who still guide their actions through imperfect predictions.\n\n\n== The Trolley problem ==\nOne last example of the relation between ethics and statistics is the problem of inaction. What if you could save 5 people, but you would know that somebody else then dies through the action that saves the other five. Many people prefer not to act. To them, an inaction is ethically more ok than the actual act, which would make them responsible for the death of one person, even if they saved five times as many people. This is also related to knowledge and certainty. Much knowledge exists that should lead people to act, but they prefer to not act at all. Obviously, this is a great challenge, and while psychology investigates this knowledge-action gap, I propose that it will still be here to stay for an unfortunately long time. If people were able to emotionally connect to information derived from numbers, just as the example above, and would be able to act reasonable, much harm could be avoided or at least minimised. This consequentialism is widely missing to date, albeit much of our constructed systems are based on quite similar rules. '''For instance, many people today do in fact understand that their actions have a negative impact on the climate, but nevertheless continue with these actions.''' Hence it is not only an inaction between knowledge and action, but also a gap between constructed systems and individuals. There is much to explore here, and as Martha Nussbaum rightly concluded in the Monarchy of Fear, even under dire political circumstances, \"hope really is both a choice and a practical habit.\" Hence it is not only utilitarianism that links statistics to ethics, but these questions also links to the social contract, and how we act reasonably or unreasonably. Many experimental modifications of the Trolley experiment were investigated by Psychology, and these led to many interpretations on why people act unreasonably. One main result is that humans may tend to minimize the harm they do to others, even if this may create more harm to people on an indirect level. Pushing a lever is a different thing from pushing a person.","== The way forward ==\nIf we want to empirically investigate agency, we first and foremost investigate individuals, or actions of entities we consider as non-variable, or consequences of actions of individuals. All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.''' Because of this, much of our current knowledge of agency is either rooted in widely deductive experimental settings or the testing of very clear hypotheses, or questions of either logic or metaphysics, which are widely associated with philosophy. \n\nThe investigation of complex system has thrived in the last decades, both from an empirical as well as from a conceptual perspective. Many methods emerged or were subsequently adapted to answer questions as well as explore relations, and this thrive towards a deeper understanding of systems is at least one important difference to agency from a methodological standpoint. Much novel data is available, and often inductively explored. The scale of complex systems makes an intervention with a focus on [[Causality and correlation|causality]] a challenge, hence many investigated relations are purely correlative. Take for instance social media, or economic flows, which can be correlatively investigated, yet causality is an altogether different matter. This creates a methodological challenge, since many of our questions regarding human systems are normative, which is why many researchers assume causality in their investigations, or at least discuss relations as if these are causal. Another methodological problem related to causality are non-linear relations, since much of the statistical canon is based on probability and linear relations. While linear relations allow for a better inference of causal explanations, the long existing yet until recently hardly explored [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics are an example that we can inductively learn about systems at a growing pace without being dependent on linearity or normal-distributions. This Bayesian revolution is currently under way, but much of the disciplines relying on statistics did not catch up on this yet. Other methodological approaches will certainly be explored to gain insight into the nuts and bolts of complex systems, yet this is only slowly emerging. \n\nThe whole globe - although not a closed system \u2013 can be seen as a global system, and this is certainly worthwhile pursuing from a methodological standpoint. Still, global dynamics consist of such diverse data, that simply the translational act to bring different data together seems almost impossible right now. While emergence can lead to novel solutions, globalisation and technology have triggered uncountable events of emergence, such as global conflicts, climate change, increase in cancer rates and biodiversity loss. Humankind did certainly not plan these potential endpoints of ourselves, instead they emerged out of unpredictable combinations of our actions, and the data that can represent them. From a methodological standpoint, these events are just as unpredictable as is the effect which two molecules have onto each other and the environment. '''Emergence is a truly cross-scalar phenomenon.''' Consequently, many methodological accounts to countermeasure threats to human societies are correlative if they are empirical. We are far away from any deep understanding of emergence, and what makes phenomena emergent.\n[[File:Climate model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Climate models are increasingly getting more accurate, but the complexity and emergence of the global climate system may never be fully understood.'''

I propose that there is a '''high road of causality''', and a '''low road of causality'''. The high road allows us to explain everything on how two things or phenomena are linked. While I reject this high road, many schools of thought consider it to be very relevant. I for myself prefer the low road of causality: May one thing or phenomena be causally linked to another thing or phenomena; if I take one away, will the other not happen? This automatically means that I have to make compromises of how much I understand about the world. \n\nit is clear we do not need to understand everything. Our ancestors did not truly understand why walking out in the dark without a torch and a weapon - or better even in a larger group - might result in death in an area with many predators. Just knowing that staying in at night would keep them safe was good enough for them. It is also good enough for me.\n\n==== Simple and complex Causality ====\n'''Let us try to understand causal relations step by step.''' To this end, we may briefly differentiate two types of causal relations.\n \nStatistical correlations imply causality if one variable (A) is actively driven by a variable (B). If B is taken away or changed, A changes as well or becomes non-existent. This relation is among the most abundantly known relation in statistics, but it has certain problems. First and foremost, two variables may be causally linked but the relation may be weak. [https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23775705 Zinc] may certainly help against the common cold, but it is not guaranteed that Zinc will cure us. It is a weak causal correlation. \n\nSecond, a causal relation of variable A and B may interact with a variable C, and further variables D, E, F etc. In this case, many people speak of complex relations. Complex relations can be causal, but they are still complex, and this [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity may confuse people]]. Lastly, statistical relations may be inflicted by biases, sample size restrictions, and many other challenges statistics face. These challenges are known, increasingly investigated, but often not solvable.\n\n==== Structure the chaos: Normativity and plausibility ====\n[[File:Black swan.jpg|thumb|right|This is probably one of the most famous examples for a universal theory, that can be disproven by one contradictory case. Are all swans white? It may seem trivial, but the black swan is representative for [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XlFywEtLZ9w Karl Popper's Falsificationism], an important principle of scientific work.]]\n\nBuilding on the thought that our mind wanders to find causal relations, and then having the scientific experiment as a powerful tool, scientists started deriving and revising theories that were based on the experimental setups. Sometimes it was the other way around, as many theories were only later proven by observation or scientific experiments. Having causality explained by scientific theories created a combination that led to physical laws, societal paradigms and psychological models, among many other things."],"4":["Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework. More on this point later. Let us now begin with a presentation of the diverse ordination types and their respective origins. \n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\nThis ordination is one of the most original ordination techniques, and builds form its underlying mechanics on the principal component analysis. However, since it is based on the chi square test, it is mainly applied for categorical data, although it can also be applied to count data, given that the dataset contains enough statistical power for this. In a nutshell, the correspondence analysis creates orthogonal axis that represent a dimension reduction of the input data, thereby effectively reducing the multivariate categorical data into artificial exes, out of which the first contains the most explanatory power. Typically, the second and third axis contain still meaningful information, yet for most datasets the first two axis may suffice. The correspondence analysis is today mostly negotiable in terms of its direct application, yet serves as an important basis for other approaches, such as the Detrended Correspondence analysis or the Canonical Correspondence analysis. This is also partly related to the largest flaw in the Correspondence analysis, namely the so called Arch-effect, where information on the first two axis is skewed due to mathematical representation of the data. Still, the underlying calculation, mainly the reciprocal averaging approach make it stand out as a powerful tool to sort large multivariate datasets based on categorical or count data. Consequently, the basic reciprocal averaging was initially very relevant for scientific disciplines such as ecology and psychology. \n\n=== Detrended Correspondence analysis ===","== At least one categorical variable ==\n'''Your dataset does not only contain continuous data.'''

Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page.","In addition, GLMs are often a part of very specific parts of science. Whether researchers implement GLMs or not is often depending on their education: it is not guaranteed that everybody is aware of their necessity and able to implement these advanced models. What makes this even more challenging is that within larger analyses, different parts of the dataset may be built upon different distributions, and it can be seen as inconvenient to report diverse GLMs that are based on different distributions, particularly because these are then utilising different evaluative criteria. The ideal world of a statistician may differ from the world of a researcher using these models, showcasing that GLMs cannot be taken for granted as of yet. Often, researchers still prioritise to follow disciplinary norms rather than go for comparability and coherence. Hence the main weakness of GLMs is a failure or flaw in the application of the model, which can be due to a lack of experience. This is especially concerning in GLMs, since such mistakes are more easily made than identified. \n\nSince analyses using GLMs are often part of a larger analysis scheme, experience is typically more important than, for instance, with simple regressions. Particularly, questions of model reduction showcase how the pure reasoning of the frequentists and their probability values clashes with more advanced approaches such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that builds upon a penalisation of complexity within models. Even within the same branch of science, the evaluation of p-values vs other approaches may differ, leading to clashes and continuous debates, for instance within the peer-review process of different approaches. Again, it remains to be seen how this development may end, but everything below a sound and overarching coherence will be a long-term loss, leading maybe not to useless results, but to at least incomparable ones. In times of [[Meta-Analysis]], this is not a small problem.\n\n== Outlook ==\nIntegration of the diverse approaches and parameters utilised within GLMs will be an important stepping stone that should not be sacrificed just because even more specific analysis are already gaining dominance in many scientific disciplines. Solving the problems of evaluation and model selection as well as safeguarding the comparability of complexity reduction within GLMs will be the frontier on which these approaches will ultimately prove their worth. These approaches have been available for more than half of a century now, and during the last decades more and more people were enabled to make use of their statistical power. Establishing them fully as a part of the standard canon of statistics for researchers would allow for a more nuanced recognition of the world, yet in order to achieve this, a greater integration into students curricular programs will be a key goal.\n\n== Key Publications ==\n\n\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Inductive]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"6":["[[File:ConceptClusteringMethods.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Cohort Study]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || [[:Category:Future|Future]]\n|}\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n'''In short:''' Clustering is a method of data analysis through the grouping of unlabeled data based on certain metrics.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Clustering SCOPUS.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits for Clustering until 2019.'''

Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as ''similarity measure'' or ''distance measure'', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named \"unsupervised learning\", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term \"clustering\" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.\n\n== Data Simulation ==\nThis article deals with simulated data. This section contains the function used to simulate the data. For the purpose of this article, the data has three clusters. You need to load the function on your R environment in order to simulate the data and perform clustering.","'''How do I know?'''\n* Classification is performed when you have (X, y) pair of data (where X is a set of independent variables and y is the dependent variable). Hence, you can map each X to a y. Clustering is performed when you only have X in your dataset. So, this decision depends on the dataset that you have.\n\n\n== Network Analysis ==\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n'''You have decided to do a Network Analysis.'''

The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape.\nImportantly, the actual distance between nodes is thus not equatable with the physical distance in a [[Glossary|visualisation]]. Sometimes, nodes that are visually very close to each other are actually very far away. The actual distance between elements of the network should be measured based on the \"number of lines which it is necessary to traverse in order to get from one point to another.\" (Scott 1988, p.114)\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Network Types.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Different network structures.'''

The dyads BE and BF - i.e. the connections between B and E, and B and F, respectively - are equally long in this network although BF appears to be shorter. This is due to the visual representation of the network, where B and F are closer to each other. Additionally, the central role of A becomes clear.

Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3). Surrounding actors may provide leverage or influence that affect the agent's actions (Borgatti et al. 2009)","'''How do I know?'''\n* Classification is performed when you have (X, y) pair of data (where X is a set of independent variables and y is the dependent variable).

Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation.

Observations can be unreliable, and errors in measurements in astronomy was a prevalent problem in the 18th and 19th century. Fisher equally recognised the mess - or variance - that nature forces onto a systematic experimenter (Rucci & Tweney 1980).

This is done in order to see the true effect of the variable of interest on a dependent variable. Fundamental idea of ANCOVA is based on hypothesis testing, its goal is to evaluate multiple mutually exclusive theories about our [[Glossary|data]], where null hypothesis claims that the means of the groups are equal, and alternative [[Glossary|hypothesis]] rejects that based on p-value. Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.\n\n== Assumptions ==\n'''Regression assumptions'''  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.\n'''ANOVA assumptions'''\n# Variances between groups are homogeneous.\n# Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.\n'''Specific ANCOVA assumptions'''\n# A further specific (but optional) assumption is homogeneity of slopes. It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate. Since ANCOVA is hypothesis-based test, we need to have a understanding and well developed question about our data that we want an answer to, before we can generate a hypothesis and run the test.\n\n\n===Data preparation===\nIn order to demonstrate One-way ANCOVA test we will refer to balanced dataset \"anxiety\" taken from the \"datarium\" package. The data provides the anxiety score, measured at three time points, of three groups of individuals practicing physical exercises at different levels (grp1: basal, grp2: moderate and grp3: high). The question is \"What treatment type has the most effect on anxiety level?\"\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ninstall.packages(\"datarium\")\n#installing the package datarium where we can find different types of datasets\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n\n===Exploring the data===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata(\"anxiety\", package = \"datarium\")\ndata = anxiety\nstr(data)\n#Getting the general information on data\n\ncor(data$t1, data$t3, method = \"spearman\")\n#Considering the correlation between independent and dependent continious variables in order to see the level of covariance\n<\/syntaxhighlight>","[[File:Histogram_of_residuals(model_1).png|250px|thumb|right]]\n3.

This notion is based on the general ANCOVA steps:\n\n1) Run a regression between the independent(covariate) and dependent variables.\n\n2) Identify the residual values from the results.\n\n3) Run an ANOVA on the residuals.\n\nBefore running ANCOVA test with adjusted before treatment anxiety score (t1 = covariate) let us run the ANOVA test only on groups and after treatment anxiety score(t3) in order to see the impact of ANCOVA test on Sum of Squares of Errors.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nmodel_3<- lm(t3~group, data = data)\nAnova(model_3, type = \"II\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:Anova_model3.png|300px|frameless|center]]\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nmodel_1 <- lm(t3~t1+group, data = data)\nAnova(model_1, type = \"II\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:Anova_model1.png|300px|frameless|center]]\n\nAs you can see after adjustment of berfore treatment anxiety score(t1 = covariate) Sum of Squares of Errors decreased from 102.83 to 9.47 meaning that the \"noise\" from covariate was taken under control by making it possible to evaluate the effect of treatment types only.\n\nSo let us recall our main question \"What treatment type has the most effect on anxiety level?\"\n\nAs we can see from the test result above there is a statistically significant difference in after treatment anxiety score between the groups, F(2, 41) = 218.63, p < 0.0001.\n\nThe F-test showed a significant effect somewhere among the groups. However, it did not tell us which pairwise comparisons are significant.

The data must convey a message to the receiver and be durable (2, 3). Often, Content Analysis focuses on data that are difficult or impossible to interpret with other methods (3). The data may exist 'naturally' and be publicly available, for example verbal discourse, written documents, or visual representations from mass media (newspapers, books, films, comics etc.); or be rather unavailable to the public, such as personal letters or witness accounts. The data may also be generated for the research purpose (e.g. interview transcripts) (1, 2, 4).  \n\nWhile there is a wide range of qualitative Content Analysis approaches, this entry will focus on joint characteristics of these. For more information on the different variations, please refer to Schreier (2014) in the Key Publications.","== Normativity ==\n==== Quality Criteria ====\n* Reliability is difficult to maintain in the Content Analysis. A clear and unambiguous definition of codes as well as testings for inter-coder reliability represent attempts to ensure inter-subjectivity and thus stability and reproducibility (3, 4). However, the ambiguous nature of the data demands an interpretative analysis process - especially in the qualitative approach. This interpretation process of the texts or contents may interfere with the intended inter-coder reliability.\n* Validity of the inferred results - i.e. the fitting of the results to the intended kind of knowledge - may be reached a) through the researchers' knowledge of contextual factors of the data and b) through validation with other sources, e.g. by the means of triangulation. However, the latter can be difficult to do due to the uniqueness of the data (1-3). Any content analysis is a reduction of the data, which should be acknowledged critically, and which is why the coding scheme should be precise and include the aforementioned explanation, examples and exclusion criteria.\n\n==== Connectedness ====\n* Since verbal discourse is an important data source for Content Analysis, the latter is often used as an analysis method of transcripts of standardized, [[Open Interview|open]], or [[Semi-structured Interview|semi-structured interviews]].\n* Content Analysis is one form of textual analysis. The latter also includes other approaches such as discourse analysis, rhetorical analysis, or [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis (2). However, Content Analysis differs from these methods in terms of methodological elements and the kinds of questions it addresses (2).\n\n\n== Outlook ==\n* The usage of automated coding with the use of computers may be seen as one important future direction of the method (1, 5). To date, the human interpretation of ambiguous language imposes a high validity of the results which cannot (yet) be provided by a computer. Alas, the development of an appropriate algorithm and text recognition software pose a challenge. The meaning of words changes in different contexts and several expressions may mean the same. Especially in terms of qualitative analyses, this currently makes human coders indispensable. Yet, the emergence of big data, Artificial Intelligence and [[Machine Learning]] might make it possible in the foreseeable future to use automated coding more regularly and with a high validity.\n* Another relevant direction is the shift from text to visual and audio data as a primary form of data (5). With ever-increasing amounts of pictures, video and audio files on the internet, future studies may refer to these kinds of sources more often.\n\n== Key publications ==\nKuckartz, U. (2016).

For more information on the different variations, please refer to Schreier (2014) in the Key Publications.\n\n==== General Methodological Process ====\n* Any Content Analysis starts with the ''Design Phase'' in which the research questions are defined, the potential sources are gathered, and the analytical constructs are established that connect the prospective data to the general target of the analysis. These constructs can be based on existing theories or practices, the experience and knowledge of experts, or previous research (2).\n* Next, the ''Unitizing'' is done, i.e. the definition of analysis units. It may be distinguished between sampling units (= sources of data, e.g. newspaper articles, interviews) and analysis units (= units of data that are coded and analyzed, e.g. single words or broader messages), with different approaches to identifying both (see Krippendorff 2004).\n* Also, the ''sampling'' method is determined and the sample is drawn.\n* Then, the ''Coding Scheme'' - or 'Codebook' - is developed and the data are coded. 'Coding' generally describes the transfer of the available data into more abstract groups. A code is a label that represents a group of words that share a similar meaning (3). Codes may also be grouped into categories if they thematically belong together. There are two typical approaches to developing the coding scheme: a rather theory-driven and a rather data-driven approach. In a theory-driven approach, codes are developed based on theoretical constructs, research questions and elements such as an interview guide, which leads to a rather deductive coding procedure. In a data-driven approach, the coding system is developed as the researcher openly scans subsamples of the available material and develops codes based on these initial insights, which is a rather inductive process. Often, both approaches are combined, with an initial set of codes being derived from theory, and then iteratively adapted through a first analysis of the available material.\n* With the coding scheme at hand, the researcher reads (repeatedly) through the data material and assigns each analysis unit to one of the codes. The ''coding process'' may be conducted by humans, or - if sufficiently explicit coding instructions are possible - by a computer. In order to provide reliability, the codes should be intersubjective, i.e. every researcher should be able to code similarly, which is why the codes must be exhaustive in terms of the overarching construct, mutually exclusive, clearly defined, have unambiguous examples as well as exclusion criteria.\n* Last, the coded data are ''analyzed and interpreted'' whilst taking into account the theoretical constructs that underlie the research. Inferences are drawn, which - according to Mayring (2000) - may focus on the communicator, the message itself, the socio-cultural context of the message, or on the message's effect. The learnings may be validated in the face of other information sources, which is often difficult when Content Analysis is used in cases where there is no other possibility to access this knowledge. Finally, new hypotheses may also be formulated (all from 1, 2).\n\n[[File:Example Content Analysis (1).jpg|500px|thumb|right|'''An exemplary interview transcript from a person that was admitted to an emergency center.'''

Correlations are also used in both inductive and deductive approaches. This versatility makes correlation analysis one of the most frequently used quantitative methods to date.\n\n'''There are different forms of correlation analysis.''' The Pearson correlation is usually applied to normally distributed data, or more precisely, data that shows a [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/students-t-distribution\/ Student's t-distribution]. Alternative correlation measures like [https:\/\/www.statisticssolutions.com\/kendalls-tau-and-spearmans-rank-correlation-coefficient\/ Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho] are usually applied to variables that are not normally distributed. I recommend you just look them up, and keep as a rule of thumb that Spearman's rho is the most robust correlation measure when it comes to non-normally distributed data.\n\n==== Calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient r ====\nThe formula to calculate [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2B_UW-RweSE a Pearson correlation coefficient] is fairly simple. You just need to keep in mind that you have two variables or samples, called x and y, and their respective means (m). \n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-02 um 09.46.54.png|400px|center|thumb|This is the formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient r.]]\n<br\/>\n\n=== Conducting and reading correlations ===\nThere are some core questions related to the application and reading of correlations. These can be of interest whenever you have the correlation coefficient at hand - for example, in a statistical software - or when you see a correlation plot.<br\/>\n\n'''1) Is the relationship between two variables positive or negative?''' If one variable increases, and the other one increases, too, we have  a positive (\"+\") correlation. This is also true if both variables decrease. For instance, being taller leads to a significant increase in\u00a0[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3534609\/ body weight]. On the other hand, if one variable increases, and the other decreases, the correlation is negative (\"-\"): for example, the relationship between 'pizza eaten' and 'pizza left' is negative. The more pizza slices are eaten, the fewer slices are still there. This direction of the relationship tells you a lot about how two variables might be logically connected. The normative value of a positive or negative relation typically has strong implications, especially if both directions are theoretically possible. Therefore it is vital to be able to interpret the direction of a correlative relationship. \n\n'''2) Is the correlation coefficient small or large?''' It can range from -1 to +1, and is an important measure when we evaluate the strength of a statistical relationship. Data points may scatter widely in a [[Correlation_Plots#Scatter_Plot|scatter plot,]] or there may be a rather linear relationship - and everything in between. An example for a perfect positive correlation (with a correlation coefficient ''r'' of +1) is the relationship between temperature in [[To_Rule_And_To_Measure#Celsius_vs_Fahrenheit_vs_Kelvin|Celsius and Fahrenheit]]. This should not be surprising, since Fahrenheit is defined as 32 + 1.8\u00b0 C. Therefore, their relationship is perfectly linear, which results in such a strong correlation coefficient. We can thus say that 100% of the variation in temperature in Fahrenheit is explained by the temperature in Celsius.","'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Correlation Plots, including Scatter Plots, Line charts and Correlograms.

This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables.

And always have in mind, '''correlations can tell you whether two variables are related, but cannot tell you anything about the causality between the variables!'''\n\nWith a bit experience, you can recognize quite fast, if there is a relationship between the variables. It is also possible to see, if the relationship is weak or strong and if there is a positive, negative or sometimes even no relationship. You can visualize correlation in many different ways, here we will have a look at the following visualizations:\n\n* Scatter Plot\n* Scatter Plot Matrix\n* Line chart\n* Correlogram\n\n\n'''A note on calculating the correlation coefficient:'''\nGenerally, there are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's rank coefficient. \n'''Pearson's correlation coefficient''' is the most popular among them. This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables. They show every observation as a dot in the graph and the further the dots scatter, the less they explain. The position of the dot on the x- and y-axis represent the values of the two numeric variables.\n[[File:MilesHorsePower2.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n\n=== R Code ===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n#Plotting the scatter plot\nplot(x = mtcars$mpg,\n     y = mtcars$hp,\n     main = \"Correlation between Miles per Gallon and Horsepower\",\n     xlab = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n     ylab = \"Horsepower\",\n     pch = 16,\n     col = \"red\",\n     las = 1,\n     xlim = c(min(mtcars$mpg), max(mtcars$mpg)),\n     ylim = c(min(mtcars$hp), max(mtcars$hp)))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>","The parameters are different from the previous scatter plots.

Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic where many other leisure activities were not available due to restrictions, many people turned to outdoor activities such as bird watching. \n\nThis trend in citizen participation is supported by technical development making bird identification easier through the usage of identification apps. Smartphone apps such as \u201ceBirds\u201d help to identify species and also upload photos and the location where the individual was observed. This leads to a growing global online-community of bird watchers who create new data points in observation databases that scientists and environmentalists can make use of for conservation research or planning. For instance, in Canada, the number of people submitting photos to eBirds increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020 (8).\n\nBecause many bird watchers are novices, bird identification is not always carried out correctly. This is a general problem of citizen science. In the case of eBirds, bird experts volunteer as reviewers who check photos for correct determination, especially in the case of rare species that are uncommon in a certain area. This increases the quality of the data (8). However, a study conducted in the UK has shown that citizen science data may be reliable only for widespread and common species, even with many data points and a good coverage of the area (9). \n\nScientists hope that [[Citizen_Science|citizen science]] data may fill data gaps, for instance in the tropics. However, comparisons to data from Bird Life International have shown that the bird abundances for rare species in the tropics are strongly over-estimated. A likely reason is that bird observers are very determined to find these rare species and thereby overlook or under-record more common species and focus on rare ones (10). \nNevertheless, as technology progresses, identification apps are becoming better and easier to use. Moreover, scientists are working on new approaches to include such data into their research in meaningful ways. This trend of increasing citizen participation is thus likely to continue.\n\nTelemetry is another method that was further developed in recent years, although it has been used already for decades in wildlife ecology. Telemetry is \u201cthe system of determining information about an animal through the use of radio signals from or to a device carried by the animal\u201d (11). For birds, this method can be applied in areas ranging in size from restricted breeding territories of resident bird species to movement patterns of international migratory species. Also, the distribution patterns of infectious diseases of migratory species can be tracked (11). However, for some birds, negative effects on nesting behavior were observed (12). \n\n== Key publications ==\n=== Theoretical ===\n\nFuller, R. J., & Langslow, D. R. (1984).

It often occurs in fields like engineering, finance, or economics to analyze trends and patterns over time.

There is no such thing as a normal weight, but studies from indigenous communities show a normal distribution in the weight found in their populations. Within our wider world, this is clearly different. Yet before we bash the Western diet, please remember that never before in the history of humans did we have a more steady stream of calories, which is not all bad.\n\n'''Distributions can have different [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XSSRrVMOqlQ skews].''' There is the symmetrical skew which is basically a normal distributions or bell curve that you can see on the picture.

And how can you recognize it when you have a [[Barplots, Histograms and Boxplots|boxplot]] in front of you? Or a histogram? The best way to learn it, is to look at it. Always remember the ideal picture of the bell curve (you can see it above), especially if you look at histograms. If the histogram of your data show a long tail to either side, or has multiple peaks, your data is not normally distributed. The same is the case if your boxplot's whiskers are largely uneven.\n\nYou can also use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normal distribution. If the test returns insignificant results (p-value > 0.05), we can assume normal distribution.","In the following example, the standardised residuals are the residuals divided by the standard deviation.

In phenomenon that can be counted, such as sports activities in minutes per day, most people will tend to a lower amount of minutes, and few to a high amount of minutes.","Reality is complex as people like to highlight today, but in a statistical sense that is often true. Most real datasets do not show a perfect model fit, but instead may individual data points deviate from the perfect fit the model assumes. What is now critical, is to assume that the error reflected by the residuals is normally distributed. Why, you ask? Because if it is not normally distributed, but instead shows a flawed pattern, then you missed an important variable that influences the distribution of the residuals. The distance from the points from the line should be normally distributed, which can be checked through a histogram.\n[[File:HistogramResiduals.png|thumb|right|The histograms shows you that the residuals of the model cars are normally distributed.]] What does this mean in terms of hands on inspection of the results?

If residuals are normally distributed, then you may realise that all errors are equally distributed across the relation. In reality, this is often not the case. Instead we often know less about one part of the data, and more about another part of the data. In addition to this we do often have a stronger relation across parts of the dataset, and a weaker understanding across other parts of the dataset. These differences are important, as they hint at underlying influencing variables or factors that we did not understand yet. Becoming versatile in reading the residuals of a linear model becomes a key skill here, as it allows you to rack biases and flaws in your dataset and analysis.

Residuals should be distributed like stars in the sky. If they are not, then your error is not normally distributed, which basically indicates that you are missing some important information. \n\nThe third and last problem you can bump into with your residuals are gaps. Quite often you have sections in your data about which you know nothing about, as you have no data for this section. An example would be if you have a lot of height measurement of people between 140-180 cm in height, and one person that is 195 cm tall. About the section between 180-195cm we know nothing, there is a gap.\n \nSuch flaws within residuals are called errors. These errors are the reason why all models are wrong. If a model would be perfect, then there would be probably a mistake, at least when considering models in statistics. Learning to read statistical models and their respective residuals is the daily bread and butter of statistical modelling. The ability to see flaws in residuals as well as the ability to just see a correlation plot in consider the strength of the relation, if any exists, is an important skill in data mining.

The distribution describes how the means of small samples of a normal distribution are distributed around the distributions true mean.

Depending on the kind of t-test to be conducted, a different t-statistic has to be used. The t-statistic is a random variable which is distributed according to the t-distribution, from which rejection intervals can be constructed, to be used for hypothesis testing.\n[[File:prbdst3.png|450px|thumb|center|Fig.1: The probability density function of the t-distribution for 9 degrees of freedom.

Finally, the results of the process are summarized and evaluated for all participants (4).\n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe literature indicates a variety of benefits that the Delphi method offers. \n* Delphi originally emerged due to a lack of data that would have been necessary for traditional forecasting methods. To this day, such a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem remains a reason to choose Delphi. Delphi may also be an appropriate choice if the collective subjective judgment by the experts is beneficial to the problem-solving process (2, 4, 5, 6).\n* Delphi can be used as a form of group counseling when other forms, such as face-to-face interactions between multiple stakeholders, are not feasible or even detrimental to the process due to counterproductive group dynamics (4, 5).\n* The value of the Delphi method is that it reveals clearly those ideas that are the reason for disagreements between stakeholders, and those that are consensual (5).\n* Delphi can be \"(...) a highly motivating experience for participants\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309) due to the feedback on the group's opinions that is provided in subsequent questioning stages.\n* The Delphi method with its feedback characteristic has advantages over direct confrontation of the experts, which \"(...) all too often induces the hasty formulation of preconceived notions, an inclination to close one's mind to novel ideas, a tendency to defend a stand once taken, or, alternatively and sometimes alternately, a predisposition to be swayed by persuasively stated opinions of others.\" (Okoli & Pawlowski 2004, p.2, after Dalkey & Helmer)\n* Additionally, Delphi provides several advantages over traditional surveys:\n** Studies have shown that averages of group responses are superior to averages of individual responses. (3)\n** Non-response and drop-out of participants is low in Delphi processes. (3)\n** The availability of the experts involved allows for the researchers to (a) get their precognitions on the issue verified by the participating experts and to (b) gain further qualitative data after the Delphi process. (3)","After the third round, the participants were additionally asked to fill out survey questions on a 1-5 [[Likert Scale]] about how reliable their considered their own forecasts, and how much attention they had paid to the others' forecasts and comments when these were re-distributed, both regarding each variable individually. This was done to better understand each individual's thought process.\n<br>\n[[File:Delphi - Exemplary study Kauko & Palmroos 2014 results.png|800px|thumb|center|'''The results for the Delphi process.''' It shows that the mean estimates of the group became better over time, and were most often quite close to the actual realisation. Source: Kauko & Palmroos 2014, p.326.]]\n<br>\nThe forecasting results from the Delphi process could be verified or falsified with the real developments over the next months and years, so that the researchers were able to check whether the responses actually got better during the Delphi process. '''They found that the individual responses did indeed converge over the Delphi process, and that the \"Delphi group improved between rounds 1 and 3 in 13 of the questions.\"''' (p.320). They also found that \"[d]isagreeing with the rest of the group increased the probability of adopting a new opinion, which was usually an improvement\" (p.322) and that the Delphi process \"clearly outperformed simple trend extrapolations based on the assumption that the growth rates observed in the past will continue in the future\", which they had calculated prior to the Delphi (p.324). Based on the post-Delphi survey answers, and the results for the 15 variables, the researchers further inferred that \"paying attention to each others' answers made the forecasts more accurate\" (p.320), and that the participants were well able to assess the accuracy of their own estimates. The researchers calculated many more measures and a comparison to a non-Delphi forecasting round, which you can read more about in the publication. Overall, this example shows that the Delphi method works in that it leads to more accurate results over time, and that the process itself helps individuals better forecast than traditional forecasts would.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Linstone, H.

Instead, the process must be adapted to the research design and underlying problem (4).\n* The proper selection of participating experts constitutes a major challenge for Delphi processes (3, 4, 5, 6). In addition, the researchers should be aware that any expert is likely to forecast based on their specific sub-system perspective and might neglect other factors (4).\n* The monitor (= researcher) must not impose their own preconceptions upon the respondents when developing the questionnaire but be open for contributions from the participants. The questions should be concise and understandable and should not incentivise the participant to \"get the job over with\" (Linstone & Turoff 1975, p.568; 5).\n* Diverse forms of [[Glossary|bias]] might occur on the part of the participants that need to be anticipated by the researcher. These include discount of the future, over-optimism \/ over-pessimism, misinterpretations with regard to the complexity and uncertainty involved in forecasting the future as well as other forms of bias that may be imposed through the feedback process (4, 6).\n* The responses must be adequately summarized, analyzed and presented to the participants (see the variety of measures for 'consensus' in What the method does)). \"Agreement about a recommendation, future event, or potential decision does not disclose whether the individuals agreeing did so for the same underlying reasons. Failure to pursue these reasons can lead to dangerously false results.\" (Linstone & Turoff 1975, p.568).\n* Disagreements between participants should be explored instead of being ignored so that the final consensus is not artificial (4).\n* The participants should be recompensated for their demanding task (4)\n\n\n== Normativity ==\n==== Connectedness \/ nestedness ====\n* While Delphi is a common forecasting method, backcasting methods (such as [[Visioning & Backcasting|Visioning]]) or [[Scenario Planning]] may also be applied in order to evaluate potential future scenarios without tapping into some of the issues associated with forecasting (see more in the [[Visioning|Visioning]] entry)\n* Delphi, and the conceptual insights gathered during the process, can be a starting point for subsequent research processes.\n* Delphi can be combined with qualitative or quantitative methods beforehand (to gain deeper insights into the problem to be discussed) and afterwards (to gather further data).\n\n==== Everything normative related to this method ====\n* The Delphi method is highly normative because it revolves around the subjective opinions of stakeholders.\n* The selection of the participating experts is a normative endeavour and must be done carefully so as to ensure a variety of perspectives.\n* Delphi is an instrument of [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] research that may be used both to find potential policy options as well as to further academic proceedings. Normativity is deeply rooted in this connection between academia and the 'real-world'.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\n==== Open questions ====\n* The diverse fields in which the Delphi method was applied has diversified and thus potentially confounded its methodological homogeneity, raising the need for a more comparable application and reporting of the method (6, 7)"],"18":["''General principles''\n* Facilitate continuous evaluation\n* Mitigate conflict constellations\n* Enhance capabilities for and interest in participation\n<br>\n\n==== Challenges ====\nThere is a wide range of potential pitfalls challenging the achieval of the ideal-typical model.\n\n* Mauser et al. (2013) remark that the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved need to be clarified from the beginning and existent inequalities need to be removed. Further, they comment that integrated research modes demand new methods and concepts, new institutional arrangements, organizational [[Glossary|competencies]] and tailored funding possibilities. The cooperation between science and society requires reflexive learning processes, appropriate communication tools and also needs to reflect on the role of science in the overall endeavour. Also, the authors highlight that there may be inertia to change in the given system which needs to be overcome.\n* Lang et al. (2012) name various issues in the framing of problems (lack of problem awareness, unbalanced problem ownership), processual issues (insufficient legitimacy of the actors involved, conflicting methodological standards, lack of integration (knowledge, structures, [[Glossary|communication)]], discontinuous [[Glossary|participation]]), as well as challenges concerning the development of solutions (ambiguity of results, fear to fail, limited solution options, lack of legitimacy of transdisciplinary outcomes, capitalization on distorted research results, issues when tracking impacts). Also, \"[a]rguing from a more conventional research perspective, scientists might be skeptical with respect to reliability, validity, and other epistemological and methodological aspects of collaborative research (\u2018\u2018credibility\u2019\u2019). Practitioners and stakeholders, on the other hand, might be skeptical regarding the practical relevance of the results (\u2018\u2018salience\u2019\u2019).\" (Lang et al. 2012)\n* Hall & Rourke (2014) expand on communicative challenges, claiming that \"[n]ot all of the challenges that threaten TDSS [transdisciplinary sustainability science] are communication challenges, but communication breakdown can exacerbate any of them. Because of its centrality, care must be taken by collaborators to cultivate a healthy communication dynamic; however, given the many perspectives involved in a typical TDSS project, this will not be easy. These projects meet complex problems with complex responses, entailing the need to remain flexible and responsive to participant requirements and the need to modify the approach if new information and values arise.\" They highlight communicative challenges especially in the framing of problems (exclusion of important perspectives, different views of the problem) and the conduction of the research (unwillingness to share personal perspectives, failure to recognize or articulate differences in individual assumptions, uncertainties and incomplete or incompatible knowledge, limited cognitive abilities to integrated individual partial knowledge).\n\n==== Methods of transdisciplinary research ====\nSeveral scientific methods are useful for transdisciplinary work. Many methods used in TD research represent single elements of a broader transdisciplinary inquiry, such as [[Interviews]] which may be used in a first step of [[Glossary|consultation]]. Other methods, however, originate from transdisciplinary endeavours or are strongly associated to them. Among these, noteworthy methods include:\n\n* [[Visioning & Backcasting|Visioning]] as well as [[Scenario Planning]], which strongly favor transdisciplinary research.\n* [[Living Labs & Real World Laboratories|Living Labs & Real-World Laboratories]] as research environments that facilitate transdisciplinary research.\n* Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) can be used to evaluate scenarios.\n* [[Citizen Science]] can also be transdisciplinary.\n\n==== Skills & Tools ====\nVarious Skills & Tools may facilitate transdisciplinary research and help solve some of the challenges mentioned above. Among these are:","The course '''Methods of Environmental Sciences''' covers a broad cross-section of those scientific methods and approaches that are central to sustainability research as well as further Wiki entries that frame the presented methods in the light of the Wiki's conceptual perspective. \n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n==== Definition & History of Methods ====\nWithin this lecture we deeply focus on the formation of a new arena in science that is including not only system knowledge, but also normative knowledge as well as transformative knowledge.

Here, we give a tentative overview on the developments up until now.\n* [[History of Methods in Sustainability Science]]\n\n==== Design Criteria of Methods in Sustainability Science ====\nThere are several design criteria that allow you to systematise methods. Many of these criteria are part of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d in normal science ''sensu strictu'' Kuhn.

However, '''there has been an increasing recognition that disciplinary viewpoints and approaches may no longer be sufficient to solve prevalent challenges''' that span across several scientific and societal spheres. Examples for this are ecological threats such as biodiversity loss or socio-technological challenges such as digitalisation which demand the creation of new theoretical and empirical scientific insights, but also action-oriented solutions that can be applied in policy, business, education, culture and such. With his landmark 1994 publication, Michael Gibbons introduced the term \"Mode 2 research\" which highlights this emerging form of scientific inquiry that is \"characterised by closer interaction between scientific, technological and industrial modes of knowledge production, by the weakening of disciplinary and institutional boundaries, by the emergence of more or less transient clusters of experts, often grouped around large projects of various kinds, and by the broadening of the criteria of quality control and by enhanced social accountability.\" (Gibbons 1994, p.68)\n\nTo this end, multi- and interdisciplinary research modes (see above) are research modes that already cross disciplinary boundaries to some extent, sharing knowledge or jointly creating it, but transdisciplinary research best represents this new form of knowledge production. Mode 2 research and transdisciplinary research have therefore often been used synonymously. Transdisciplinary research facilitates the creation of not only system knowledge (the current state) and target knowledge (the intended state), but especially of transformational knowledge (how to get there) that considers the demands and preconditions of all relevant stakeholders. Thus, transdisciplinary research is of particular interest where there is a lack of practical knowledge about a specific problem, solution pathways are not yet known and there is a need for societal negotiation throughout the development of solutions. (Arnold & Piontek, p.145f)\n\n'''Transdisciplinary research is of special importance to Sustainability Science and has received immense recognition in this field in the last years.''' This is because \"[s]ustainability is also inherently transdisciplinary\" (Stock & Burton 2011, p.1091), as it builds on the premise of solving real-world problems which are deeply nestled in ecological, political, economic and social processes and structures and therefore cannot be understood and solved without engaging with these spheres (Kates et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary research is a suitable approach for Sustainability Science: it allows to incorporate the knowledge of relevant stakeholders; it considers the normative dimensions involved in societal endeavors (that is, diverging norms, goals and visions of different societal spheres); and it increases [[Glossary|legitimacy]], ownership and accountability for the jointly developed solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Stock & Burton 2011). The integrative transdisciplinary approach highlights systemic interdependencies, enables a better understanding of complex issues and provides better knowledge to develop socially robust and applicable, effective solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2015)."],"19":["Linking to the historical development of methods, we can thus clearly claim that Critical Theory (and Critical Realism) opened a new domain or mode of thinking, and its impact can be widely felt way beyond the social science and philosophy that it affected directly. However, coming back to bias, the answer to an almost universal rejection of empiricism will [[Big problems for later|not be followed here]]. Instead, we need to come back to the three foundational theories of philosophy, and need to acknowledge that reason, social contract and utilitarianism are the foundation of the first empirical disciplines that are at their core normative (e.g. psychology, social and political science, and economics). Since bias can be partly related to these three theories, and consequentially to specific empirical disciplines, we need to recognise that there is an overarching methodological bias. This methodological bias has a signature rooted in specific design criteria, which are in turn related to specific disciplines. Consequently, this methodological bias is a disciplinary bias - even more so, since methods may be shared among scientific disciplines, but most disciplines claim either priority or superiority when it comes to the ownership of a method.\n\nThe disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","The course '''Scientific methods - Different paths to knowledge''' introduces the learner to the fundamentals of scientific work. It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances.\n\n'''Inductive vs. deductive'''\nSome branches of science try to verify or falsify hypotheses, while other branches of science are open towards the knowledge being created primarily from the data. Hence the difference between a method that derives [[Glossary|theory]] from data, or one that tests a theory with data, is often exclusive to specific branches of science. To this end, out of the larger availability of data and the already existing knowledge we built on so far, there is a third way called abductive reasoning. This approach links the strengths of both [[Glossary|induction]] and [[Glossary|deduction]] and is certainly much closer to the way how much of modern research is actually conducted. \n\n'''Scales'''\nCertain scientific methods can transcend spatial and temporal scales, while others are rather exclusive to a specific partial or temporal scale. While again this does not make one method better than another, it is certainly relevant since certain disciplines almost focus exclusively on specific parts of scales. For instance, psychology or population ecology are mostly preoccupied with the individual, while macro-economics widely work on a global scale. Regarding time there is an ever increasing wealth of past information, and a growing interest in knowledge about the future. This presents a shift from a time when most research focused on the presence.","* [[Design Criteria of Methods]]\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Critical Theory & Bias ===\n'''Critical theory'''\nThe rise of empiricism and many other developments of society created critical theory, which questioned the scientific [[Glossary|paradigm]], the governance of systems as well as democracy, and ultimately the norms and truths not only of society, but more importantly of science. This paved the road to a new form of scientific practice, which can be deeply normative, and ultimately even transformative.  \n\n'''The pragmatism of [[Glossary|bias]]'''\nCritical theory raised the alarm to question empirical inquiry, leading to an emerging recognition of bias across many different branches of science. With a bias being, broadly speaking, a tendency for or against a specific construct (cultural group, social group etc.), various different forms of bias may flaw our recognition, analysis or interpretation, and many forms of bias are often deeply contextual, highlighting the presence or dominance of constructed groups or knowledge. \n\n'''Limitations in science'''\nRooted in critical theory, and with a clear recognition of bias, science(s) need to transform into a reflexive, inclusive and solution-oriented domain that creates knowledge jointly with and in service of society. The current scientific paradigms are hence strongly questioned, reflecting the need for new societal paradigms. \n\n* [[Bias and Critical Thinking]]\n* [[Bias and Critical Thinking (German)]]\n\n=== Experiment & Hypothesis ===\n'''The scientific method?'''\nThe testing of a [[Glossary|hypothesis]] was a breakthrough in scientific thinking. Another breakthrough came with Francis Bacon who proclaimed the importance of observation to derive conclusions. This paved the road for repeated observation under conditions of manipulation, which in consequence led to carefully planned systematic methodological designs. \n\n'''Forming hypotheses'''\nOften based on previous knowledge or distinct higher laws or assumptions, the formulation of hypotheses became an important step towards systematic inquiry and carefully designed experiments that still constitute the baseline of modern medicine, psychology, ecology and many other fields. Understanding the formulation of hypotheses and how they can be falsified or confirmed is central for large parts of science. Hypotheses can be tested, are ideally parsimonious - thus build an existing knowledge - and the results should be reproducible and transferable. \n\n'''Limitations of hypothesis'''\nThese criteria of hypotheses showcase that despite allowing for a systematic and - some would say - \u2018causal\u2019 form of knowledge, hypotheses are rigid at best, and offer a rather static worldview at their worst. Theories explored in hypothesis testing should be able to match the structures of experiments. Therefore, the underlying data is constructed, which limits the possibilities of this knowledge production approach.\n\n* [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing]]\n* [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing (German)]]\n\n=== Causality & Correlation ===\n'''Defining causality'''\nBuilding on the criteria from David Hume, we define causality through temporal links (\"if this - then this\"), as well as through similarities and dissimilarities. If A and B cause C, then there must be some characteristic that makes A and B similar, and this similarity causes C. If A causes C, but B does not cause C, then there must be a dissimilarity between A and B. Causal links can be clearly defined, and it is our responsibility as scientists to build on this understanding, and understand its limitations. \n\n'''Understanding correlations''' Correlations statistically test the relation between two continuous variables. A relation that - following probability - is not a coincidence but from a statistical standpoint meaningful, can be called a significant correlation."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.\n\nSoft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a 'system' an \"(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world\" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a 'system'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking''' according to Checkland. Source: Checkland 2000, p.18]]\n\nSystem Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: ''System Analysis'' and ''System Dynamics'' (1).\n\n''System Analysis'' \"(...) is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). ''System Analysis'', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below. For more information, refer to the entry on [[System Analysis]].","'''Jay Forrester''', a MIT computer scientist, subsequently coined the term 'System Dynamics' in the 1960s and was the first to discuss the Causal Loop Diagrams concept (1). The expression 'Systems Thinking' was introduced by Forrester's student '''Barry Richmond''' in 1987 (6). Considerable contributions to the field were voiced by management researcher '''Peter Checkland''' from the 1970s on, who built upon the General System Theories (GST) but then introduced the distinction between 'hard' und 'soft' system thinking (see below) (9). \"In the sixties and seventies the environmental movement identified many complex problems that integrated the economy and resource management, as a more holistic perspective emerged. The concept \"sustainable development\" is perhaps the most recognised term to address the need of an interdisciplinary approach. In recent years, the importance of creating an educational basis that incorporates a system approach is increasingly realised, and for the last decade or so System Thinking has been finding its way into universities and corporations.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6; 6)\n\nSystem Thinking can be applied in any discipline to understand underlying structures and develop models of the system that is analysed. However, sustainability science relies heavily on System Thinking since it acknowledges the complex and lagged interrelationships within and in between ecological, economic, social and further systems. A Key Publication in this field was 'Thinking in Systems' by '''Donella Meadows''', who had been co-authoring the landmark 'Limits to Growth' before. Sustainability Science, which attempts to bridge the world how it is with the world how it ought to be, relies on System Thinking to understand how the world is and in which '[[Glossary|leverage points]]' one needs to intervene to bring about change. System Thinking can also be applied outside of scientific research, e.g. to analyze company-internal processes, for marketing purposes etc. (see e.g. 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nBefore explaining System Thinking, it should first be explained what is a 'system'.\n\n==== Systems, System Thinking, System Analysis & System Dynamics ====\nA system is a \"(...) network of multiple variables that are connected to each other through causal relationships\", based on which the network \"(...) expresses some sort of behaviour, which can only be characterized through observation as a whole\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.11). This behavior remains persistent in a variety of circumstances. More simply put, a system is a \"(...) collection of connected things (...) that influence one another.\" (Toole 2005, p.2) Both the collection of elements and their interactions are important elements of the system which is emphasized by saying that a system is 'more than a collection of its parts' (Arnold & Wade 2015, p.2).\n\nEvery system is \"(...) defined by its boundaries\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.13). The borders we draw for our system analysis influence which level of detail we apply to our view on the system, and which elements we investigate. System elements can be animate (animals, humans) or inanimate (rocks, rain), conceptual (motivation) or real (harvest), quantifiable (money) or rather qualitative (well-being) (2). For example, a system could be a tree, with the leaves, the stem and such elements interacting with each other, but also the forest in which our tree interacts with the soil, the weather, other plants, animals and inanimate objects. The system could also be the globe, where this forest interacts with other ecosystems, or the system in which Planet Earth interacts with the rest of the universe - our solar system. For more background on the definition of System Boundaries, please refer to [[System Boundaries|this entry.]]","== Strengths & Challenges ==\nSystem Thinking provides advantages over linear analyses that do not do complex problems justice. \n* System Thinking helps find the real roots of problems instead of applying 'end of pipe' solutions that only fix symptoms, not causes. It also helps not to disimprove things by fixing one element but worsening another one while doing so (1).\n* Human thinking often tends to fall into simple cause-and-effect patterns that make it easier to understand the world. Applying System Thinking and the creation of Causal Loop Diagrams may be seen as solutions to this tendency of the human mind to simplify complex relationships where several variables influence each other. System Thinking makes it easier to get a feeling for how things really interact, as opposed to a very simplified model that neglects too many interactions. However, one should keep in mind that any model is just a (more or less detailed) approximation of the real world, and sometimes, problems are not as complex as they seem.\n\nHowever, there are some potential pitfalls when developing Causal Loop Diagrams.\n* The variables in the CLD must be quantitatively increasable or decreasable states of elements, not the elements themselves. For example, a variable should not be \"attitude towards something\", which cannot be increased or decreased but only described. Instead, the CLD should work with \"tolerance towards something\". The variables should also be self-explanatory and neutral, because \"the action is in the arrows\" (Haroldsson 2004, p.42) (1, 2).\n* The communicative purpose of a CLD can only be seen as accomplished when the reader \/ viewer understands the thinking behind the model and the principles that guide the system (1). This is especially relevant since Causal Loop Diagrams can become huge, which makes it increasingly difficult to find root causes for developments and not lose the overview (see Figure above).\n\n\n== Normativity ==\n==== Everything normative about this method ====\nChu (2011) raises concerns about the notion of 'systems'. In her view, common definitions of systems (especially those which Checkland would consider 'hard' systems) imply that the 'real' world existed of systems and non-systems, and that the complexity of each system model (which CLDs are a form of) was dependent on how the system 'is'. Instead, she suggests to realise that the complexity of any system model depends on how complex the researcher decides to develop the model: \"How much detail one takes into account in models depends entirely on the perspective one takes that is on what needs to be taken into account.\" (Chu 2011, p.184). Mitchell (2004) claims equally: \"The idealized and partial character of our representations suggests that there will never be a single account that can do all the work of describing and explaining complex phenomena. Different degrees of abstraction, attention to different components of a system, are appropriate to our varying pragmatic goals and conceptual and computational abilities.\" (p.1) \n\nDeveloping a CLD does include the steps of [[System Boundaries|setting system boundaries]] and defining the research interest and thus the necessary elements to be included. In this regard, these concerns highlight that a CLD (and any form of system modelling) is always dependent on the previously made decisions and simplifications and any results of the system analysis must acknowledge this. Chu therefore dismisses the idea of quantifying the complexity of systems based on the properties of system models; and Mitchell suggests not to attempt to break down the world into singular reductionist models that do not represent real complexity, but rather to endorse 'integrative pluralism' that combines different models of the same phenomenon and thus allows for more realistic representations. This critique is in line with Checkland's 'soft' system understanding that offers an alternative to the assumption that systems are objectively real and independent from the observer's relation to it (9)."],"21":["{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || '''[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]''' || '''[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n''Teaching is the best way to learn.''\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# '''Select the topic you want to learn more about.''' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don't go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain \"Economics\" or \"Physics\" in one go.\n# '''Find someone to talk to'''. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don't have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# '''Make notes.''' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and\/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# '''Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.''' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it. Congratulations!","== The way forward ==\n[https:\/\/www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu\/ The Feynman lectures] provide the most famous textbook volumes on physics. Richard Feynman and his coauthors compiled these books in the 1960, yet to this day, many consider these volumes to be the most concise and understandable introduction to physics. Granted, Feynman's work is brilliant. '''At the same time, however, this fact also means that in the 1960s the majority of the knowledge necessary for an introduction in physics was already available.''' While we may consider that much happened ever since, students can still use these textbooks today. Something similar can be claimed for basic statistics, although it should be noted that physics is a scientific discipline, while statistics is a scientific method. Some disciplines use different methods, and many disciplines use statistics as a method. However, the final word on statistics has not been said, as the differences between [[A matter of probability|probability]] statistics and [[Bayesian Inference|Bayesian]] statistics are not yet deeply explored. Especially Bayesian statistics may provide a vital link to experiments, yet this has been hardly explored to date. Critical spirits may say that the teaching of statistics is often the most normal part of any sort of normal science study program, and this reputation led to statistics more often than not being characterized by a lack of excitement for students. We should not only know and teach the basics, but also engage in the discussion what these all may mean.\n \n'''Philosophy can be thought together well with statistics.''' Unfortunately until today they are not very much associated with each other.\nSomething surprisingly similar can be said about philosophy. While much of the basic principles are known, these are hardly connected. Philosophy hence works ever deeper on specifics, but most of its contributors move away from a unified line of thinking. This is what makes Derek Parfits work stand out, since he tried to connect the different dots, and it will be the work of the next decades to come to build on his work, and improve it if necessary.\n\nWhile philosophy and statistics both face a struggle to align different lines of thinking, it is even more concerning how little these two are aligned with each other. Statistics make use of philosophy at some rare occasions, for instance when it comes to the ethical dilemmas of negatively affecting people that are part of a study. While these links are vital for the development of specific aspects of statistics, the link between moral philosophy and statistics has hardly been explored so far. In order to enable statistics to contribute to the question how we ought to act, a systematic interaction is needed. I propose that exploring possible links is a first step, and we start to investigate how such connections work. The next step would be the proposal of a systematic conceptualisation of these different connections. This conceptualisation would then need to be explored and amended, and this will be very hard work, since both statistics and moral philosophy are scattered due to a lack of a unified theory, and hardly anyone is versatile in both fields.. This makes a systematic exploration of such a unifying link even more difficult to explore is the question who would actually do that. Within most parts of the current educational system, students learn either empirical research and statistics, or the deep conceptual understanding of philosophy. Only when we enable more researcher to approach from both sides - empirical and conceptual - will we become increasingly able to bridge the gap between these two worlds.","== Links & Further Reading ==\n* [https:\/\/karrierebibel.de\/feynman-methode\/ Karrierebibel]\n* [https:\/\/blog.doist.com\/feynman-technique\/ ToDo-ist]\n* [https:\/\/www.goodwall.io\/blog\/feynman-technique\/ Goodwall]\n* [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts Thomas Frank - How to learn with the Feynman Technique] \n----\n__NOTOC__\n[[Category:Skills_and_Tools]]\n[[Category:Productivity Tools]]\n[[Category:Personal Skills]]\n[[Category:Team Size 1]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Christopher Franz."],"22":["==Fixed effects vs. Random effects==\n[[File:Smoking trooper.jpg|thumb|right|If smoking is a fixed or a random effect depends on the study design]]\nWithin [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical standpoint the value of such pre-tests may be limited at best.","==== The independent variable ====\nEqually, predictors may vary in their [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#Validity | validity and reliability]]. This may be related to the way the predictors are measured, how constructed specific predictors are, or if they can actually serve as proxies to answer the questions we want to answer. Money can be a predictor for happiness, but it has clearly its limitations, and the amount of money needed to have a decent life may differ between countries. Also remember that different [[Data_formats | data formats]] are highly relevant in order to understand the nature of your data.\n\n==== Random factors ====\nThis brings us to the next factor that can affect our model validity. There are many things we might want to know when creating a statistical model, but there may also be things that we do not want to know. Statistically speaking, these are ''random factors'' or ''random variables''. Regarding these, we explicitly exclude the variance that is created by these parts of the dataset, because we want to minimise their effects. An example would be a medical study that wants to investigate the effect of a certain drug on the recovery rate of some diseased patients. In such studies, the information whether a patient is a smoker or not is often included as a random factor, because smoking negatively affects many diseases and the respective recovery rates. We know that smoking makes many things worse (from a medical standpoint) and this is why such variables are excluded. More on random factors can be found [[ Field_experiments#Fixed_effects_vs._Random_effects | here]].\n\n==== The model ====\nThe next part of a [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis | statistical model]] that needs to be examined when discussing the limitations of statistics is the statistical test or model itself. Models differ in terms of their mathematical foundations. This can lead to some models being more complicated than others, relying on different measures of model performance, and are also sometimes differently utilised within different scientific communities or disciplines. Data visualisations showcase how different branches of sciences have different ways to approach how to [[Introduction_to_statistical_figures | show data in figures]], which can be diverse and often follow specific norms within different scientific disciplines.  \n\nThis is difficult to explain in a nutshell, but let me try: basically, different historical developments in the diverse disciplines, as well as the specific relation of a discipline towards the respective theory and topics, enable differences in how statistics are being utilised by different disciplines. Yet, there are also examples of exchanges and even coevolutionary patterns. For instance, the [[ANOVA]] started within agricultural science, but equally unleashed its potential in psychology, medicine and ecology, as these all rely strongly on the [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|testing of hypotheses.]] Econometrics and engineering build more strongly on [[Correlations | correlative]] testing, which is again related to the specifics of these disciplines. Most simple tests are [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Normativity | hardly being used these days]], a phenomena that unites almost all disciplines, yet sometimes even very [[Back_of_the_envelope_statistics | simple calculations]] can offer robust answers. However, the difference between scientific disciplines regarding their statistical use does not always make sense, and is not necessarily rooted in reasonable decisions.","====Randomisation====\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 15.54.10.png|thumb|Field experiments are often divided into quadrangles, and these then represent a certain treatment or treatment combination. In a randomized experiment, a study sample is then randomly divided into treatment and control groups.]]\nField experiments try to compensate for gradients that infer variance within a sample design by increasing the number of samples. However, in order to uncouple the effects of underlying variance, [https:\/\/isps.yale.edu\/node\/16697 randomisation] is central. Take the example of an agricultural field that has more sandy soils on one end, and more loamy soils on the other end. If now all samples of one treatment would be on the loamy end of the field, and all samples of another treatment would be at the sandy end of the field, then the treatment effect would contain an artefact of the soil gradient. Randomisation in fields is hence essential to maximize independence of the treatment effect from the underlying variance. A classical chessboard illustrates the design step of randomisation quite nicely, since field experiments are often divided into quadrangles, and these then represent a certain treatment or treatment combination. Especially in [https:\/\/www.sare.org\/Learning-Center\/Bulletins\/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch\/Text-Version\/Basics-of-Experimental-Design agricultural fields], such an approach was also following a certain pragmatism, since neighbouring quadrangles might have a tendency to influence each other, i.e. through root competition. While this error is often hard to take into account, it is quite relevant to notice that enough replicates might at least allow to tame this problem, and make the error introduced by such interactions less relevant overall. Just as we should apply randomisation when sampling for instance a representative sample from a population, the same approach is applied in the design of experiments.\n\n====Blocking====\n[[File:Block Experiments.jpg|thumb|Designing an experiment using block effects.]]\nIn order to tame the variance of the real world, [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=10ikXret7Lk blocking] was a plausible approach. By basically introducing agricultural fields as [https:\/\/www.ndsu.edu\/faculty\/horsley\/RCBD.pdf blocks], the variance from individual blocks can be tamed. This was one of the breakthroughs, as the question of what we want to know i.e. hypothesis testing, was statistically uncoupled from the question what we do not want to know, i.e. the variance inferred from individual blocks. Consequently, the samples and treatment combinations need to be randomised within the different blocks, or can be alternatively replicated within these blocks. This has become established as a standard approach in the designing of experiments, often for rather pragmatic reasons. For instance are [https:\/\/www.sare.org\/Learning-Center\/Bulletins\/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch\/Text-Version\/Basics-of-Experimental-Design\/Common-Research-Designs-for-Farmers agricultural fields] often showing local characteristics in terms of soil and microclimate, and these should be tamed by the clear designation of blocks and enough blocks in total within the experiment. The last point is central when thinking in terms of variance, since it would naturally be very hard to think in terms of variance regarding e.g. only two blocks. A higher number of blocks allow to better tame the block effect. This underlines the effort that often needs to go into designing experiments, since a sufficient number of blocks would basically mean that the effort can be multiplied by the number of blocks that are part of the design. Ten blocks means ten times as much work, and maybe with the result that there is no variance among the blocks overall."],"23":["==Replication of experiments==\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 17.10.27.png|thumb|One famous example from the discipline of psychology is the Milgram shock experiment carried out by Stanley Milgram a professor from the Yale University in 1963.]]\nField experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments. Consider Occam\u2019s razor also when designing a study.\n\n==External Links==\n===Articles===\n\n[https:\/\/explorable.com\/field-experiments Field Experiments]: A definition\n\n[https:\/\/www.tutor2u.net\/psychology\/reference\/field-experiments Field Experiments]: Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Field_experiment#Examples Examples of Field Experiments]: A look into different disciplines\n\n[https:\/\/conjointly.com\/kb\/experimental-design\/ Experimental Design]: Why it is important\n\n[https:\/\/isps.yale.edu\/node\/16697 Randomisation]: A detailed explanation","This radical development coincides with yet another revolution that shattered science, namely the digital age.

What emerged out of the development of [https:\/\/sustainabilitymethods.org\/index.php\/Interactions#The_field_experiment field experiments] was an almost exact opposite trend considering the reduction of complexity. What do we learn from singular cases? How do we deal with cases that are of pronounced importance, yet cannot be replicated? And what can be inferred from the design of such case studies? A famous example from ethnographic studies is the [http:\/\/www.eisp.org\/818\/ Easter Island]. Why did the people there channel much of their resources into building gigantic statues, thereby bringing their society to the brink of collapse? While this is a surely intriguing question, there are no replicates of the Easter Islands. This is at a first glance a very specific and singular problem, yet it is often considered to be an important example on how unsustainable behaviour led to a collapse of a while civilisation. Such settings are referred to as [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/natural-experiment Natural Experiments]. From a certain perspective, our whole planet is a Natural Experiment, and it is also from a statistical perspective a problem that we do not have any replicates, besides other ramifications and unclarity that derives such single case studies, which are however often increasingly relevant on a smaller scale as well. With a rise in qualitative methods both in diversity and abundance, and an urge for understanding even complex systems and cases, there is clearly a demand for the integration of knowledge from Natural Experiments. '''From a statistical point of view, such cases are difficult and challenging due to a lack of being reproducible, yet the knowledge can still be relevant, plausible and valid.'''

Hence this crisis is comparable to many previous factors and patterns regarding some layers of information, but also novel and not transferable regarding other dynamics. We did however understand based on the single case of this financial crisis that certain constructs in our financial systems are corrupt if not broken. The contribution to develop the financial world further is hence undeniable, even so far that many people agree that the changes that were being made are certainly not enough. \n\nAnother prominent example of a single case or phenomena is the Covid pandemic that emerges further. While much was learned from previous pandemics, this pandemic is different, evolves different, and creates different ramifications. The impact of our societies and the opportunity to learn from this pandemic is however undeniable. While classical experiments evolve knowledge like pawns in a chess game, moving forward step by step, a crisis such as the Covid pandemic is more like the horse in a chess game, jumping over larger gaps, being less predictable, and certainly harder to master. The evolution of knowledge in an interconnected world often demands a rather singular approach as a starting point. This is especially important in normative sciences, where for instance in conservation biology many researchers approach solutions through singular case studies.

The Disney Method may be used to come up with ideas for projects or products, to solve problems and conflicts, to develop strategies and to make decisions. The method was invented by Walt Disney who thought of a movie not only as a director, but also as an audience member and a producer to come up with the best possible result.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Productive brainstorming\n* Understanding for other perspectives\n* Strong team spirit \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe Disney method process is circular.

With many participants, discussion rounds tend to be sprawling, slow and dominated by strong speakers. If you want to facilitate a discussion that is more effective, energetic, and inclusive, the World Caf\u00e9 is a helpful technique.

The participants will be divided into as many subgroups as there are stations. Each subgroup will visit every station. The moderator welcomes the subgroup participants and introduces the question. Within a given time slot, the subgroups will discuss the question and write down their ideas and insights, before they then wander to the next station. The moderators remain with their station and welcome the next group. They present the question plus a broad overview of the insights of the former group and deepen the discussion with the new group. After the parcours has been completed by all subgroups, the moderators present the collective discussion results of each question to the full group. \n\nIt is helpful to have one moderator who is in charge of the clock and who manages the parcours direction.\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\nhttp:\/\/www.theworldcafe.com\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.methodenkartei.uni-oldenburg.de\/uni_methode\/world-cafe\/\n\n----\n__NOTOC__\n[[Category:Skills_and_Tools]]\n[[Category:Collaborative Tools]]\n[[Category:Team Size 11-30]]\n[[Category:Team Size 30+]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Dagmar M\u00f6lleken."],"25":["[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page.","'''How do I know?'''\n* Check the entry on [[Data formats]] to understand the difference between categorical and numeric variables.\n* Investigate your data using <code>str<\/code> or <code>summary<\/code>.

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting. Therefore we need to check if our dataset only includes numbers and then transform our dataset into a matrix, using <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>as.matrix()<\/syntaxhighlight> function.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata(\"mtcars\")\nmatcars <- as.matrix(mtcars)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nAlso, for better representation, we are going to rename the columns, giving them their full names. It is not a mandatory step, but it makes our heatmap more comprehensible.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfullcolnames <- c(\"Miles per Gallon\", \"Number of Cylinders\",\n                  \"Displacement\", \"Horsepower\", \"Rear Axle Ratio\",\n                  \"Weight\", \"1\/4 Mile Time\", \"Engine\", \"Transmission\",\n                  \"Number of Gears\", \"Number of Carburetors\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we are using the transformed dataset (matcars) to create the heatmap. Other used arguments are explained below.\n[[File:Heatmap.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\nheatmap(matcars, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, \n        scale = \"column\", labCol = fullcolnames, \n        margins = c(11,5))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n== How to interpret a heatmap? ==","== How to interpret a heatmap? ==\n\nIn the default color palette the interpretation is usually the following: the darker the color the higher the responding value, and vice versa. For example, let\u2019s look at the feature <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>\u201cNumber of Carburetors\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight>. We can see that '''Maserati Bora''' has the darkest color, hence it has the largest number of carburetors, followed by '''Ferrari Dino''', which has the second-largest number of carburetors. While other models such as '''Fiat X1-9''' or '''Toyota''' have the lightest colors. It means that they have the lowest numbers of carburetors. This interpretation can be applied to every other column.\n\n==Explanation of used arguments==\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Colv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Rowv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> are used to remove the dendrograms from rows and columns. A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects and is added on top of the heatmap by default if the argument is not specified. The main reason for removing it here is that it is a different method of data visualisation which is not mandatory for the heatmap representation and requires a separate article to review it fully.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>scale = \u201ccolumn\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to normalize the columns of the matrix (to absorb the variation between columns). As it was stated previously, normalization is needed due to the algorithm by which the colors are set. Here in our dataset, the values of features \u201cGross horsepower\u201d and \u201cDisplacement\u201d are much larger than the rest. Therefore, without normalization, these two columns will be all marked approximately equally high and all the other columns equally low. Normalizing means that we keep the relative values in each column but not the real numbers. In the interpretation sense it means that, for example, the same color of features \u201cMiles per Gallon\u201d and \u201cNumber of Cylinders\u201d of Mazda RX4 does not mean that the actual values are the same or approximately the same (placed in the same bin). It only means that the relative values of each of these cells in corresponding columns are the same or are in the same bin.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>margins<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to fit the columns and rows names into the graph. The reason we used it here is because of the renaming of the columns, which is resulted in longer names that did not fit well by themselves.\n\nColoring options for the heatmap\nThe choice of color for the heatmap is one of the most important aspects of creating an understandable and nice-looking representation of the data. If you do not specify the color (as in the example above) then the default color palette will be applied. However, you can use the argument <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>col<\/syntaxhighlight> and choose from a wide variety of palettes for coloring your heatmap.\n\nThere are two options of setting a color palette for the heatmap:\n* First option is to use the palettes from R: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>cm.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heat.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>rainbow()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>terrain.color()<\/syntaxhighlight>  or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>topo.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight> \n* The second option is to install color palettes packages such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>RColorBrewer<\/syntaxhighlight>","'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Treemaps.

All this triggered not only an enormous cultural change, but more importantly an increasing exchange, leading to schools of thoughts that became increasingly connected through writing, and also often in thinking. '''Logic is an example of a branch of philosophy that linked the ancients (Plato, Confucius, [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/buddha\/ Buddha]) with the philosophy of the enlightenment.''' This was an important precondition in medieval times for a systematic line of thinking, triggering or further developing pragmatic, analytic and sceptic approaches, among others. Logic as a part of philosophy provided the basis for a clear set of terms and rhetoric within inquiry, and would later become even more important with regards to rationality. The early need for a clear wording was thus deeply rooted in philosophy, highlighting the importance of this domain until today. \n\nMany concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a. Ibn al-Haytham]. Emerging from the mathematics of antiquity and combining this with the generally rising investigation of physics, Alhazen was the first to manipulate [[Field_experiments|experimental conditions]] in a systematic sense, thereby paving the way towards the scientific method, which would emerge centuries later. Alhazen is also relevant because he could be considered a polymath, highlighting the rise of more knowledge that actually enabled such characters, but still being too far away from the true formation of the diverse canon of [[Design Criteria of Methods|scientific disciplines]], which would probably have welcomed him as an expert on one matter or the other. Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on '''the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.'''\n\n==== Before Enlightenment - ''Measure And Solve'' ====\n[[File:Normal_Mercator_map_85deg.jpg|thumb|300px|left|'''Mercator world map.''' Source: [https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mercator-Projektion Wikipedia]]] \n'''Another breakthrough that was also rooted in geometry was the compilation of early trade maps.''' While many European maps were detailed but surely not on scale (Ebstorfer Weltkarte), early maps still enabled a supra-regional trade. The real breakthrough was the [[Geographical Information Systems|Mercator map]], which was - restricted to the knowledge at the time - the first map that enabled a clear navigation across the oceans, enabling colonialism and Western dominions and domination of the world. This is insofar highly relevant for methods, because it can be argued that the surplus from the colonies and distant countries was one of the main drivers of the thriving of the European colonial rulers, their economies and consequently, their science. A direct link can be made between the [[Normativity of Methods|inequalities]] that were increased by colonialism and the thriving of Western science, including the development of scientific methods.","Equal considerations can be made for the early methodological approaches that rose to prominence in the antique, the most notable among them being astrological observations, mathematics, physics, or early medicine. It was often within urban cultures that such early examples of scientific methods flourished, and are still known today. A noteworthy example are the precise astronomical calculations of the Maya, which were often closely linked with their daily conduct, since the movement of the planets played a vital role in their religion. Their writing system shows similarity to the Japanese writing and many other approaches that provide a link to a documentation through paintings and thus deserve a deep interpretation well beyond the content of the symbols itselves. This documentation hence now only shows us how scientific methods emerged, but also allow us to investigate the past with our current methods. To this end, paintings are a form of art that deserves a closer analytical look, and many diverse approaches exist that allow for a close examination of the preserved record. It was the financial surplus in urban settlements that led to the developments of much what is now know as different epochs of painters, and the digital age has made many paintings accessible through the Internet. With the representation through paintings, there is also a rising record of maps, and other forms of more systematic representations that give testimony of a clear geographical picture of the past. Equally, the texts of Herodot can be seen as one of the earliest geographical accounts, albeit in writing. The scientific analysis of these records is vital to understand the past, and the density of the historical record has often increased the closer we move to the present. \n\nWith the rise of photography an altogether different kind of record was created, and the development of modern cartography had an equally dramatic influence on the density of knowledge that became available. The detailed scientific examination of the diverse sources since the development of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg was already a a severe development leading to an exponential growth of the printed word. The development of printed images and multiplication of pictures that came later was an altogether different media unleashed, leading to a totally different world. Once these image started moving and even talking, human civilisation created an exponentially growing record of the world, of which the Internet is the latest development. '''From a methodological standpoint, this diversity of media triggered two relevant developments:''' An ever-increasing differentiation of empirical analyiss, and severe philosophical consequences of this brave new world. The role of art and its critique changed fundamentally, with consequences that translate directly into modern society. It is impossible to do justice to these developments here, yet Walter Benjamin should be noted as an early stepping stone towards a clearer role of the critique within society. This triggered direct and long overdue consequences for the scientific method as well, and led to a redevelopment of the role of the critical observer, commentator and ultimately unleashed a more nuanced view on science and its consequences. Methodologically, [[deconstruction]] as well as the critical perspective emerged over the last decades, all the while the possibilities of modern sciences [[History of Methods|diversified]] as well. The exponential track of the 20th century triggered a diversity in scientific approaches that dwarves by far the scale of everything that existed before. Along the way, our understanding of the distant past has become a question of the preservation of the immense emerging record. The amount of information that is being created and stored on the Internet is increasing at a pace that would have been unthinkable before, leaving us to at least try to spare some thoughts about the role this information may play in the future. Will everything be preserved for longer times? What is the turnover of our data? And what will be the meaning of the information we create for future people?","[[File:printing-press-2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|'''Invention of the printing press'''.

A link can be made to translations and interpretations of the Bible, and many other religious discourses are indeed not different from deep text analysis and the derivation of interpretations. Hermeneutics go clearly a step further, and hence are one of the earliest and to date still most important scientific methods. [[Thought Experiments]] were another line of thinking that started to emerge more rapidly. By focussing on ''What if'' questions, scientists considered all sorts of questions to derive patterns of even law of nature ([https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/galileo\/ Galileo]) and also directed their view into the future. Thought experiments were in an informal way known since antiquity, yet during medieval times these assumptions became a trigger to question much of what was supposedly known. Through experiments they became early staring points for subsequent more systematic experimentation. \n\n[[File:Somer_Francis_Bacon.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Francis Bacon.''' Source: [https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Francis_Bacon Wikipedia]]] \nIt was [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/francis-bacon\/ Francis Bacon] who ultimately moved out of this dominance of thinking and called for the importance of empirical inquiry. '''By observing nature and its phenomena, we are able to derive conclusion based on the particular.''' Bacon is thus often coined to be the father of 'the scientific method', an altogether misleading term, as there are many scientific methods. However, empiricism, meaning the empirical investigation of phenomena and the derivation of results or even rules triggered a scientific revolution, and also a specialization of different scientific branches. While Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had been a polymath less than a century ago, Bacon (1561-1626) triggered an increase in empirical inquiry that led to the deeper formation of scientific disciplines. Many others contributed to this development: [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/locke\/ Locke] claimed that human knowledge builds on experience, and [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/hume\/ Hume] propelled this into skepticism, casting the spell of doubt on anything that is rooted in belief or dogma. By questioning long standing knowledge, science kicked in - among other things - the door of god himself, a circumstance that is too large to be presented here in any sense. What is important however is that - starting from the previous age of diverse approaches to knowledge - the combination of empiricism on the one end, and the associated philosophical developments on the other end, the age of reason had dawned.\n\n[[File:Timeline of methods V2.jpg|600px|frame|center|'''A timeline of major breakthroughs in science.'''

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

They are a bit over simplistic if they contain only one level of information such as three groups and their abundance, and can be more advanced if they contain two levels of information such as in stacked barplots. These can be shown as either absolute numbers or proportions, which may make a dramatic difference for the analysis or interpretation.\n\n'''Correlation plots''' ('xyplots') are the next staple in statistical graphics and most often the graphical representation of a correlation. Further, often also a regression is implemented to show effect strengths and variance. Fitting a [[Regression Analysis|regression]] line is often the most important visual aid to showcase the trend. Through point size or color can another information level be added, making this a really powerful tool, where one needs to keep a keen eye on the relation between correlation and causality. Such plots may also serve to show fluctuations in data over time, showing trends within data as well as harmonic patterns.\n\n'''Boxplots''' are the last in what I would call the trinity of statistical figures. Showing the variance of continuous data across different factor levels is what these plots are made of. While histograms reveal more details and information, boxplots are a solid graphical representation of the Analysis of Variance. A rule of thumb is that if one box is higher or lower than the median (the black line) of the other box, the difference may be signifiant.\n\n[[File:Xyplot.png|250px|thumb|left|'''A Correlation plot.'''

Jordan and Mitchell (2015) highlight that the society lacks a set of data privacy related rules that prevent nefarious actors from potentially using the data that exists publicly or that they own can be used with powerful Machine Learning methods for their personal gain at the other' expense [7]. \n\nThe ubiquity of Machine Learning empowered technologies have made concerns about individual privacy and social security more relevant.

As such, academic research in Machine Learning techniques and their performances continue to be attractive in many areas of research moving forward.\n\nThere is no question that the field of Machine Learning has been able to produce powerful models with great data processing and prediction capabilities. As a result, it has produced powerful tools that governments, private companies, and researches alike use to further advance their objectives.

Search term: 'Machine Learning' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nTraditionally in the fields of computer science and mathematics, you have some input and some rule in form of a function. You feed the input into the rule and get some output. In this setting, you '''need''' to know the rule exactly in order to create a system that gives you the outputs that you need. This works quite well in many situations where the nature of inputs and\/or the nature of the outputs is well understood. \n\nHowever, in situations where the inputs can be ''noisy'' or the outputs are expected to be different in each case, you cannot hand-craft the \"[[Glossary|rules]]\" that account for ''every'' type of inputs or for every type of output imaginable. In such a scenario, another powerful approach can be applied: '''Machine Learning'''. The core idea behind Machine Learning is that instead of being required to hand-craft ''all'' the rules that take inputs and provide outputs in a fairly accurate manner, you can ''train'' the machine to ''learn'' the rules based on the inputs and outputs that you provide. \n\nThe trained models have their foundations in the fields of mathematics and computer science. As computers of various types (from servers, desktops and laptops to smartphones, and sensors integrated in microwaves, robots and even washing machines) have become ubiquitous over the past two decades, the amount of data that could be used to train Machine Learning models have become more accessible and readily available. The advances in the field of computer science have made working with large volumes of data very efficient. As the computational resources have increased exponentially over the past decades, we are now able to train more complex models that are able to perform specific tasks with astonishing results; so much so that it almost seems magical.\n\nThis article presents the different types of Machine Learning tasks and the different Machine Learning approaches in brief. If you are interested in learning more about Machine Learning, you are directed to Russel and Norvig [2] or Mitchell [3].\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe term \"Machine Learning\" does not refer to one specific method. Rather, there are three main groups of methods that fall under the term Machine Learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n=== Types of Machine Learning Tasks ===","== What the method does ==\nThe term \"Machine Learning\" does not refer to one specific method. Rather, there are three main groups of methods that fall under the term Machine Learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n=== Types of Machine Learning Tasks ===\n\n==== Supervised Learning ====\nThis family of Machine Learning methods rely on input-output pairs to \"learn\" rules. This means that the data that you have to provide can be represented as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> pairs where <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the input data (in the form of vectors or matrices) and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the output (in the form of vectors with numbers or categories that correspond to each input), also called ''true label''. \n\nOnce you successfully train a model using the input-output pair <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> and one of the many ''training algorithms'', you can use the model with new data <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X_new)<\/syntaxhighlight> to make predictions <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(y_hat)<\/syntaxhighlight> in the future.\n\nIn the heart of supervised Machine Learning lies the [[Glossary|concept]] of \"learning from data\" and from the data entirely. This begs the question what exactly is learning. In the case of computational analysis, \"a computer program is said to learn from experience '''E''' with respect to some class of tasks '''T''' and performance measure '''P''', if its performance at tasks in '''T''', as measured by '''P''', improves with experience '''E'''.\"[3]\n\nIf you deconstruct this definition, here is what you have:\n* '''Task (T)''' is what we want the Machine Learning algorithm to be able to perform once the learning process has finished. Usually, this boils down to predicting a value ([[Regression Analysis|regression]]), deciding in which category or group a given data falls into (classification\/clustering), or solve problems in an adaptive way (reinforcement learning).\n* '''Experience (E)''' is represented by the data on which the learning is to be based. The data can either be structured - in a tabular format (eg. excel files) - or unstructured - images, audio files, etc.\n* '''Performance measure (P)''' is a metric, or a set of metrics, that is used to evaluate the efficacy of the learning process and the \"learned\" algorithm. Usually, we want the learning process to take as little time as possible (i.e. we want training time time to be low), we want the learned algorithm to give us an output as soon as possible (i.e. we want prediction time to be low), and we want the error of prediction to be as low as possible.\n\nThe following figure from the seminal book \"Learning from Data\" by Yaser Abu Mostafa [1] summarizes  the process of supervised learning summarizes the concept in a succinct manner:\n\n[[File:Mostafa Supervised Learning.png|thumb|The Learning Diagram from \"Learning from Data\" by Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, & Lin (2012)]]"],"30":["Please refer to this [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi video series from 3blue1brown] for more on Neural Networks.\n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Machine Learning techniques perform very well - sometimes better than humans- on variety of tasks (eg. detecting cancer from x-ray images, playing chess, art authentication, etc.)\n* In a variety of situations where outcomes are noisy, Machine Learning models perform better than rule-based models.\n* Even though many methods in the field of Machine Learning have been researched quite extensively, the techniques still suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability.\n* Reproducibility crisis is a big problem in the field of Machine Learning research as highlighted in [6].\n* Machine Learning approaches have been criticized as being a \"brute force\" approach of solving tasks.\n* Machine Learning techniques only perform well when the dataset size is large.

Refer to Dwork [8] to learn about a concept called ''Differential Privacy'' that is closely related to data privacy in data governed world.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nThe field of Machine Learning is going to continue to flourish in the future as the technologies that harness Machine Learning techniques are becoming more accessible over time. As such, academic research in Machine Learning techniques and their performances continue to be attractive in many areas of research moving forward.\n\nThere is no question that the field of Machine Learning has been able to produce powerful models with great data processing and prediction capabilities. As a result, it has produced powerful tools that governments, private companies, and researches alike use to further advance their objectives. In light of this, Jordan and Mitchell [7] conclude that Machine Learning is likely to be one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century.","[[File:ConceptMachineLearning.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Machine Learning]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"|  '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n'''In short:''' Machine Learning subsumes methods in which computers are trained to learn rules in order to autonomously analyze data.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Machine learning.png|thumb|400px|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Machine Learning until 2019.''' Search term: 'Machine Learning' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nTraditionally in the fields of computer science and mathematics, you have some input and some rule in form of a function. You feed the input into the rule and get some output. In this setting, you '''need''' to know the rule exactly in order to create a system that gives you the outputs that you need. This works quite well in many situations where the nature of inputs and\/or the nature of the outputs is well understood. \n\nHowever, in situations where the inputs can be ''noisy'' or the outputs are expected to be different in each case, you cannot hand-craft the \"[[Glossary|rules]]\" that account for ''every'' type of inputs or for every type of output imaginable. In such a scenario, another powerful approach can be applied: '''Machine Learning'''. The core idea behind Machine Learning is that instead of being required to hand-craft ''all'' the rules that take inputs and provide outputs in a fairly accurate manner, you can ''train'' the machine to ''learn'' the rules based on the inputs and outputs that you provide. \n\nThe trained models have their foundations in the fields of mathematics and computer science. As computers of various types (from servers, desktops and laptops to smartphones, and sensors integrated in microwaves, robots and even washing machines) have become ubiquitous over the past two decades, the amount of data that could be used to train Machine Learning models have become more accessible and readily available. The advances in the field of computer science have made working with large volumes of data very efficient. As the computational resources have increased exponentially over the past decades, we are now able to train more complex models that are able to perform specific tasks with astonishing results; so much so that it almost seems magical.\n\nThis article presents the different types of Machine Learning tasks and the different Machine Learning approaches in brief. If you are interested in learning more about Machine Learning, you are directed to Russel and Norvig [2] or Mitchell [3].\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe term \"Machine Learning\" does not refer to one specific method. Rather, there are three main groups of methods that fall under the term Machine Learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n=== Types of Machine Learning Tasks ===","== What the method does ==\nThe term \"Machine Learning\" does not refer to one specific method. Rather, there are three main groups of methods that fall under the term Machine Learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n=== Types of Machine Learning Tasks ===\n\n==== Supervised Learning ====\nThis family of Machine Learning methods rely on input-output pairs to \"learn\" rules. This means that the data that you have to provide can be represented as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> pairs where <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the input data (in the form of vectors or matrices) and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the output (in the form of vectors with numbers or categories that correspond to each input), also called ''true label''. \n\nOnce you successfully train a model using the input-output pair <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> and one of the many ''training algorithms'', you can use the model with new data <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X_new)<\/syntaxhighlight> to make predictions <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(y_hat)<\/syntaxhighlight> in the future.\n\nIn the heart of supervised Machine Learning lies the [[Glossary|concept]] of \"learning from data\" and from the data entirely. This begs the question what exactly is learning. In the case of computational analysis, \"a computer program is said to learn from experience '''E''' with respect to some class of tasks '''T''' and performance measure '''P''', if its performance at tasks in '''T''', as measured by '''P''', improves with experience '''E'''.\"[3]\n\nIf you deconstruct this definition, here is what you have:\n* '''Task (T)''' is what we want the Machine Learning algorithm to be able to perform once the learning process has finished. Usually, this boils down to predicting a value ([[Regression Analysis|regression]]), deciding in which category or group a given data falls into (classification\/clustering), or solve problems in an adaptive way (reinforcement learning).\n* '''Experience (E)''' is represented by the data on which the learning is to be based. The data can either be structured - in a tabular format (eg. excel files) - or unstructured - images, audio files, etc.\n* '''Performance measure (P)''' is a metric, or a set of metrics, that is used to evaluate the efficacy of the learning process and the \"learned\" algorithm. Usually, we want the learning process to take as little time as possible (i.e. we want training time time to be low), we want the learned algorithm to give us an output as soon as possible (i.e. we want prediction time to be low), and we want the error of prediction to be as low as possible.\n\nThe following figure from the seminal book \"Learning from Data\" by Yaser Abu Mostafa [1] summarizes  the process of supervised learning summarizes the concept in a succinct manner:\n\n[[File:Mostafa Supervised Learning.png|thumb|The Learning Diagram from \"Learning from Data\" by Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, & Lin (2012)]]"],"31":["'''This sub-wiki deals with scientific methods.''' <br\/>\n\n=== What are scientific methods? ===\nWe define ''Scientific Methods'' as follows:\n* First and foremost, scientific methods produce knowledge. \n* Focussing on the academic perspective, scientific methods can be either '''reproducible''' and '''learnable'''; can be '''documented''' and are '''learnable'''; or are '''reproducible''', can be '''documented''', and are '''learnable'''. \n* From a systematic perspective, methods are approaches that help us '''gather''' data, '''analyse''' data, and\/or '''interpret''' it. Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.\n\nAlso, each scientific method that is described on this Wiki is categorized according to the Wiki's underlying [[Design Criteria of Methods]].<br\/>\n'''This means that each method fulfills one or more categories of each of the following criteria:'''\n<br\/>\n* [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] - [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n* [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] - [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n* Spatial scales: [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] - [[:Category:System|System]] - [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n* Temporal scales: [[:Category:Past|Past]] - [[:Category:Present|Present]] - [[:Category:Future|Future]]\nYou can click on each category for more information and all the entries that belong to this category.\n<br\/>\n\n\n=== Which methods can you learn about? ===\nSee all methods that have been described on this Wiki so far:\n<categorytree mode=\"pages\" hideroot=\"on\">Methods<\/categorytree>\n<br>\nWe also have what we call '''Level 2''' overview pages. <br>\nOn these pages, we present everything that is necessary for a specific field of methods in a holistic way.

This knowledge creation process follows certain principles and has a certain rigour. Knowledge that is created through scientific methods should be ideally [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/scientific-reproducibility\/ ''reproducible''], which means that someone else under the given circumstances would come up with the same insights when using the same respective methods. This is insofar important, as other people would maybe create different data under a similar setting, but all the data should answer research questions or hypotheses in the same way. However, there are some methods that may create different knowledge patterns, which is why documentation is pivotal in the application of scientific methods. Some forms of knowledge, such as the perception of individuals, cannot be reproduced, because these are singular perspectives. '''Knowledge created through scientific methods hence either follows a systematic application of methods, or a systematic documentation of the application of methods'''. Reproducible approaches create the same knowledge, and other approaches should be equally well documented to safeguard that for all steps taken it can be understood what was being done precisely. \n\nAnother possibility to define methods concerns the different stages of research in which they are applied. '''Methods are about gathering data, analysing data, and interpreting data.''' Not all methods do all of these three steps, in fact most methods are even exclusive to one or two of these steps. For instance, one may analyse [[Semi-structured Interview|structured interviews]] - which are one way to gather data - with statistical tests, which are a form of analysis. The interpretation of the results is then built around the design of the interviews, and there are norms and much experience concerning the interpretation of statistical tests. Hence, gathering data, analysing it, and then interpreting the results are part of a process that we call ''design criteria of methods''. Established methods often follow certain more or less established norms, and the norms can be broken down into the main design criteria of methods. Let us have a look at these. \n\n==== Quantitative vs Qualitative ====\n'''One of the strongest discourses regarding the classification of methods revolves around the question whether a method is quantitative or qualitative'''. [[:Category:Quantitative|''Quantitative'']] methods focus on the measurement, counting and constructed generalisation, linking the statistical or mathematical analysis of data, as well as the interpretation of data that consists of numbers to extract [[Glossary|patterns]] or support theories. Simply spoken, quantitative methods are about numbers. [[:Category:Qualitative|''Qualitative'']] methods, on the other hand, focus on the human dimensions of the observable or conceptual reality, often linking observational data or interpretation of existing data directly to [[Glossary|theory]] or concepts, allowing for deep contextual understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are ''[[Normativity of Methods|normative]]''. These two generally different lines of thinking are increasingly linked in recent decades, yet the majority of research - and more importantly, disciplines - are dominated by either qualitative or quantitative methods. While this is perfectly fine per se, there is a deep ideological trench between these two approaches, and much judgement is passed on which approach is more valid. This can be misleading if not wrong, and propose instead to choose the appropriate approach depending on the intended knowledge. However, there is one caveat: much of the scientific canon of the last decades was dominated by research building on quantitative approaches. However, new exciting methods emerge especially in qualitative research. Since novel solutions are necessary for the problems we currently face, it seems necessary that the amount as well as the proportion of qualitative research increases in the future.","The course '''Scientific methods - Different paths to knowledge''' introduces the learner to the fundamentals of scientific work. It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances.\n\n'''Inductive vs. deductive'''\nSome branches of science try to verify or falsify hypotheses, while other branches of science are open towards the knowledge being created primarily from the data. Hence the difference between a method that derives [[Glossary|theory]] from data, or one that tests a theory with data, is often exclusive to specific branches of science. To this end, out of the larger availability of data and the already existing knowledge we built on so far, there is a third way called abductive reasoning. This approach links the strengths of both [[Glossary|induction]] and [[Glossary|deduction]] and is certainly much closer to the way how much of modern research is actually conducted. \n\n'''Scales'''\nCertain scientific methods can transcend spatial and temporal scales, while others are rather exclusive to a specific partial or temporal scale. While again this does not make one method better than another, it is certainly relevant since certain disciplines almost focus exclusively on specific parts of scales. For instance, psychology or population ecology are mostly preoccupied with the individual, while macro-economics widely work on a global scale. Regarding time there is an ever increasing wealth of past information, and a growing interest in knowledge about the future. This presents a shift from a time when most research focused on the presence."],"32":["During the last decades mindfulness took a strong tooting in the western world, and the commercialisation of the principle of mindfulness led to the development of several approaches and even apps, like Headspace, that can introduce lay people to a regular practice. The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative [[Glossary|assumptions]] that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the context of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.\n\n== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having \"no mind\", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you.

The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|'''MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters\/bubbles, as in this example.''' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols. Source: [https:\/\/www.thetutorteam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/shutterstock_712786150.jpg thetutorteam.com]]]\n\n'''A Mindmap enables the visual arrangement of various types of information, including tasks, key concepts, important topics, names and more.''' It allows for a quick overview of all relevant information items on a topic at a glance. It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings. A Mindmap can also be a good tool for a [[Glossary|brainstorming]] process, since it does not focus too much on the exact relationships between the visualised elements, but revolves around a more intuitive approach of arranging information.\n\nThe central topic is written into the center of the [[Glossary|visualisation]] (e.g. a whiteboard, with a digital tool, or a large horizontally arranged sheet of paper). '''This central topic can be see as a city center on a city map, and all relevant information items then are arranged around it like different districts of the city.''' The information items should focus on the most important terms and data, and omit any unncessary details. These elements may be connected to the central topic through lines, like streets, or branches, resulting in a web structure. '''Elements may be subordinate to other elements, indicating nestedness of the information.''' Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections.","=== Differences to Concept Mapping and Mindmaps ===\n[[Concept Maps]] refer to visual representations of conceptual ideas, as introduced by Novak and colleagues in the 1970s (Trochim 1989). Information (words or short sentences) is put into boxes or circles, which are connected in a network-like structure through arrows. This is in a way comparable to a mindmap. However, [[Mindmap|Mindmaps]] do not serve the purpose of presenting a final, comprehensive overview over a specific focus on a topic, but rather an unstructured, spontaneous collection of general related ideas around one key term. Both processes - Concept Maps and Mindmaps - can be done by a single person or in a group. For example, Brown (2003) shows how group-based creation of a concept map can enhance biology teaching.\n\nBy comparison, '''Group Concept Mapping is not a mere group-based creation of a Concept Map''', but an established methodological approach which includes qualitative and quantitative elements, and can be seen as a mixed methods approach in itself, with both elements of data gathering and analysis. It is a structured form of framework development, in which ideas, thoughts, goals, needs and resources relevant to a specific topic are collected, conceptually linked, quantitatively evaluated and presented in a map-like visualisation. \n\n=== The process of Group Concept Mapping ===\nGroup Concept Mapping typically consists of six linear steps (see figure): Preparation, Statement Generation, Structuring, Representation, Interpretation, Utilization. Below, we will elaborate on each step based on the original methodological design by Trochim (1989), and present the process as done in the exemplary study by McCaffrey et al. (2019), who attempted to generate a conceptual model of good health care from the perspective of patients.\n\n[[File:Group Concept Mapping - Visualisation-2.png|600px|thumb|center|'''The process of Group Concept Mapping'''. Source: adapted from Trochim 1989, p.3]]\n\n==== 1 - Preparation ====\n'''a) Selecting the participants'''<br>\nIn the preparation phase, first, '''the group of actors is gathered''' that will contribute to the process. The individuals are selected by the facilitator, who can be a member of the relevant group itself, or an outsider. The selected group, \"[d]epending on the situation, (...) might consist of the administrators, staff or members of the board of an organization; community leaders (...); academicians or members of the policy making community; (...) representatives of relevant client populations\" or other individuals that are relevant to the topic at hand, and whose perspectives should be included in the resulting framework visualisation (Trochim 1989, 2). When selecting the participants, \"[b]road heterogeneous participation helps to insure that a wide variety of viewpoints will be considered and encourages a broader range of people to \"buy into\" the conceptual framework which results\". (Trochim 1989, 3). Individuals may be selected by hand, or by the use of stratified or purposive sampling. Trochim (1989) recommends a group to include 10-20 individuals, but larger or smaller groups are still imaginable.

The original underlying idea was to analyze how children learn, assuming that they do so by assimilating new concepts and positioning these in a cognitive conceptual framework. The idea of Concept Maps emerged from the demand for a form of assessing these conceptual understandings.\n\nImportantly, while Concept Maps are often applied in research, teaching or planning, they should not be confused with the mixed methods approach of [[Group Concept Mapping]]. The latter emerged based on Concept Maps in the 1980s, but is a more structured, multi-step process. A Concept Map further differs from a [[Mindmap]] in that the latter are spontaneous, unstructured visualisations of ideas and information around one central topic, without a hierarchy or linguistic homogeneity, and do not necessarily include labeled information on how conceptual elements relate to each other.\n\nConcept Maps '''help identify a current state of knowledge''' and show gaps within this knowledge, e.g. a lack of understanding on which elements are of importance to a question or topic, and how concepts are interrelated. Identifying these gaps helps fill knowledge gaps. Therefore, they can be a helpful tool for students or anyone learning a new topic to monitor one's own progress and understanding of the topic, and how this changes as learning units continue.\n\nFurther, Concept Maps can be '''a way of approaching a specific question''' or problem and support a systematic solution-development process. The visual representation of all relevant elements nconcerning a specific topic can thus help create new knowledge. There are even more imaginable purposes of the approach, including management and planning, creative idea-generation and more."],"34":["[[File:ConceptMixedEffectModels.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Mixed Effect Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"|''' [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n\n'''In short:''' Mixed Effect Models are stastistical approaches that contain both fixed and random effects, i.e. models that analyse linear relations while decreasing the variance of other factors.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Mixed Effects Model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Mixed Effects Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: '''Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and\/or continuous]] independent variables'''. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.","While psychology, medicine, agricultural science, biology and later ecology thus thrived in their application of experimental designs and studies, there was also an increasing recognition of information that was creating [[Bias and Critical Thinking|biases]] or otherwise falsely skewed the results. '''The ANOVA hence became amended by additional modifications, ultimately leading to more advanced statistics that were able to focus on diverse statistical effects''', and reduce the influence of skews rooted, for instance, in sampling bias, statistical bias or other flaws. Hence, [[Mixed-Effect Models]] became an advanced next step in the history of statistical models, leading to more complex statistical designs and experiments, taking more and more information into account. In addition, meta-analytical approaches led to the combination and summarising of several case studies into a systematic overview. This was the dawn of a more integrational understanding of different studies that were combined into a [[Meta-Analysis]], taking different contexts of the numerous studies into account as well. In addition, research also focused more and more onto a deeper understanding of individual case studies, with a stronger emphasis on the specific context of the respective case. Such singular cases have been of value in medical research for decades now, where new challenges or solutions are frequently published despite the obvious lack of a wider contribution. Such medical case studies report novel findings, emerging problems or other so far unknown case dynamics, and often serve as a starting point for further research. Out of such diverse origins such as [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|system thinking]], Urban Research, [[Ethnography]] and other fields in research, [[Living Labs & Real World Laboratories|real world experiments]] emerged, which take place in everyday social or cultural settings. The rigid designs of laboratory or field experiments is traded off for a deeper understanding of the specific context and case. While real world experiments emerged some decades ago already, they are only starting to gain wider recognition. All the while, the reproducibility crisis challenges the classical laboratory and field experiments, as a wider recognition that many results - for instance from psychological studies - cannot be reproduced. All this indicates that while much of our scientific knowledge is derived from experiments, much remains to be known, also about the conduct of experiments themselves.\n\n----\n[[Category: Normativity_of_Methods]]\n[[Category: Methods]]\n[[Category: Statistics]]\n[[Category: Qualitative]]\n[[Category: Deductive]]\n[[Category: Individual]]\n[[Category: System]]\n[[Category: Global]]\n[[Category: Present]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","W\u00e4hrend Psychologie, Medizin, Agrarwissenschaft, Biologie und sp\u00e4ter auch die \u00d6kologie auf diese Weise in der Anwendung von Versuchspl\u00e4nen und Studien gediehen, gab es auch eine zunehmende Anerkennung von Informationen, die [[Bias and Critical Thinking|Bias]] erzeugten oder die Ergebnisse anderweitig verzerrten.

Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many studies in medicine that investigate how a certain drug works on people to cure a disease. To this end, you want to know the effect the drug has on the prognosis of the patients. What you do not want to know is whether people are worse off if they are older, have a lack of exercise or an unhealthy diet. All these single effects do not matter for you, because it is well known that the prognosis often gets worse with higher age, and factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet choices. What you may want to know, is whether the drug works better or worse in people that have unhealthy diet choice, are older or lack regular exercise. These interaction can be meaningfully investigated by Mixed Effect Models. '''All positive factors' variance is minimised, while the effect of the drug as well as its interactions with the other factors can be tested.''' This makes Mixed Effect Models so powerful, as you can implement them in a way that allows to investigate quite complex hypotheses or questions.\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of Mixed Effect Models is the level of experience that is necessary to implement them in a meaningful way. Designing studies takes a lot of experience, and the current form of peer-review does often not allow to present the complex thinking that goes into the design of advanced studies (Paper BEF China design). There is hence a discrepancy in how people implement studies, and how other researchers can understand and emulate these approaches. Mixed Effect Models are also an example where textbook knowledge is not saturated yet, hence books are rather quickly outdated, and also often do not offer exhausting examples to real life problems researchers may face when designing studies. Medicine and psychology are offering growing resources to this end, since here the preregistration of studies due to the reproducibility crisis offers a glimpse in the design of scientific studies.","The lack of experience in how to design and conduct Mixed Effect Models-driven studies leads to the critical reality that more often than not, there are flaws in the application of the method. While this got gradually less bad over time, it is still a matter of debate whether every published study with these models does justice to the original idea. Especially around the millennium, there was almost a hype in some branches of science regarding how fancy Mixed Effect Models were considered, and not all applications were sound and necessary. Mixed Effect Models can also make the world more complicated than it is: sometimes a regression is just a regression is just a regression.\n\n==  Normativity ==\nMixed Effect Models are the gold standard when it comes to reducing complexities into constructs, for better or worse. All variables that go into a Mixed Effect Model are normative choices, and these choices matter deeply. First of all, many people struggle to decide which variables are about fixed variance, and which variables are relevant as random variance. Second, how are these variables constructed - are they continuous or categorical, and if the latter, what is the reasoning behind the category levels? Designing Mixed Effect Modell studies is thus definitely a part of advanced statistics, and this is even harder when it comes to integrating non-designed datasets into a Mixed Effect Model [[Glossary|framework]]. Care and experience are needed to evaluate sample sizes, variance across levels and variables. This brings us to the most crucial point: Model inspection.\n\n'''Mixed Effect Models are built on a litany of preconditions, most of which most researchers choose to conveniently ignore.''' In my experience, this is more often than not ok, because it does not matter. Mixed Effect Models are - bless the maximum likelihood estimation - very sturdy. It is hard to find a model that does not have some predictive or explanatory value, even if hardly any pre-conditions are met. Still, this does not mean that we should ignore these. In order to sleep safe and sound at night, I am almost obsessed with model inspection, checking variance across levels, looking at the residuals, and looking for gaps and flaws in the model's fit. We should be really conservative to this end, because by focusing on fixed and random variance, we potentiate things that could go wrong. As I said, more often than not, this is not the case, but I propose to be super conservative when it comes to your model outcome. In order to get there, we need yet another thing: Model simplification.\n\nMixed Effect Models lead the forefront of statistics, and this might be the reason why the implementation of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) as a parsimony-based evaluation criterion is more abundant here when compared to other statistical approaches. P-values fell widely out of fashion in many branches of science, as did the reporting of full models. Instead, model reduction based on information criteria approaches is on the rise, reporting parsimonious models that honour [[Why_statistics_matters#Occam.27s_razor | Occam's razor]]. Starting with the maximum model, these approaches reduce the model until it is the minimum adequate model - in other words, the model that is as simple as possible, but as complex as necessary. The AIC is about the equivalent of a p-value of 0.12, depending on the sample size, hence beware that the main question may be the difference from the null model. In other words, a model that is better from the Null model, but only just so based on the AIC, may not be significant because the p-value would be around 0.12. This links to the next point: Explanatory power.","== Outlook ==\nIn terms of Mixed Effect Models, language barriers and the norms of specific disciplines are rather strong. Explaining the basics of these advanced statistics to colleagues is an art in itself, just as the experience of researchers being versatile in [[Semi-structured Interview|Interview]]s cannot be reduced into a few hours of learning. Education in science needs to tackle this head on, and stop teaching statistics that are outdated and hardly published. I suggest that at least on a Master's level, in the long run, all students from the quantitative domain should be able to understand the preconditions and benefits of Mixed Effect Models, but this is something for the distant future. Today, PhD students being versatile in Mixed Effect Models are still outliers. Let us all hope that this statement will be outdated rather sooner than later. Mixed Effect Models are surely powerful and quite adaptable, and are increasingly becoming a part of normal science. Honouring the complexity of the world while still deriving value statements based on statistical analyses has never been more advanced on a broader scale. '''Still, statisticians need to recognize the limitations of real world data, and researchers utilising these need to honour the preconditions and pitfalls of these analyses'''. Current science is in my perception far away from reporting reproducible analyses, meaning that one and the same dataset will be differently analysed by Mixed Effect Model approaches, partly based on experience, partly based on differences between disciplines, and probably also because of many other factors. Mixed Effect Models need to be consolidated and unified, which would make normale science probably better than ever.\n\n== Key Publications ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Inductive]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"36":["== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.","For this toy dataset, since there are two dimensions, we get (at most) two egenvectors and two corresponding eigenvalues. Even if we only plot the eigenvectors scaled by their eigenvalues, we will basically have a summary data (and its spreading). At this point, the eigenpairs are be viewed as the principle components of the data.\n\n[[File: PCAEigenvector02.png|center|500px]]\n\n==== Ranking the principle components ====\nAs you may have noticed, the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. This is no coincidence. You can think of it this way: because we want to maximize the variance explained by each of the principle components, these components need to be independent from one another, therefore their orthogonality.  Thus, to define a set of principle components, you find the direction which can explain the variability in the data the most: that is your first principle component (the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue). The second principle compent will be percepdicular to the first, and explain most of what is left of the variability. This continues until the d-th principle component is found.\n\nBy doing so, you are also sorting the \"importance\" of the principle components in terms of the information amount it contains what is used to explain the data. To be clear, the sum of all eigenvalues is the total variability in the data. From here, you can choose to discard any PCs whose percentage of explained variances are low. In many cases, if around 80% of the variance can be explained by the first k PCs, we can discard the other (d - k) PCs. Of course, this is only one of the heuristics method to determine k.  You can also use thr elbow method (the scree plot) like in k-means.\n\n==== Summary ====\n* PCA is a feature extraction technique widely used to reduce dimensionality of datasets.\n* PCA works by calculating the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the initial variables in the data. These are the principle components. Number of PCs = number of eigenvectors = number of features.\n* The PCs are ranked by the eigenvalues, and iteratively show the directions in which the data spreads the most (after accounting for the previous PCs).\n* We can choose to keep a few of the first PCs that cummulatively explains the data well enough, and these are the new reduced dimension of the data.\n* Standardization is a crucial step in data pre-processing to ensure the validity of the PCA results.\n\n\n=== R Example ===\nGoing back to the example in the introduction, the dataset can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sdhilip\/nutrient-analysis-of-pizzas\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For pre-processing data\nlibrary(factoextra) # For visualization\ntheme_set(theme_bw()) # Set theme for plots\n\n# Load data\ndata <- read_csv(\"Pizza.csv\")\nhead(data)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nAs shown here, there are seven measurements of nutrients for each pizza. Our goal is to reduce these seven dimensions of information down to only two, so that we can present the main patterns in our data on a flat piece of paper.\n\nTo conduct Principle Component Analysis in R, we use <code>prcomp<\/code>. From the original data, we only select the seven nutrient measurements as input for the function. In this function, we set <code>scale = TRUE<\/code> to perform scaling and centering (so that all variables will have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).

Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis.","== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.","'''Check for missing values'''\nTo check if the data has any missing values, we can use the isnull and any methods from Pandas, like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nprint(data.isnull().any())\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis will return a table with a True value for each column that has missing values, and a False value for each column that does not have missing values.\nChecking for missing values is important because most modeling techniques cannot handle missing data. If your data contains missing values, you will need to\neither impute the missing values (i.e. replace them with estimated values) or remove the rows with missing values before fitting a model.\nIf there are missing values in the data, you can use the sum method to check the number of missing values per column, like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nprint(data.isnull().sum())\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the shape attribute to calculate the percentage of missing values per column, like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nprint(data.isnull().sum()\/data.shape[0]*100)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis can help you understand the extent of the missing values in your data and decide how to handle them.\n\n===Check for duplicate entries===\nTo check if there are duplicate entries in the data, we can use the duplicated method from Pandas, like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nprint(data.duplicated())\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis will return a True value for each row that is a duplicate of another row, and a False value for each unique row.\nIf there are any duplicate entries in the data, we can remove them using the drop_duplicates method, like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata = data.drop_duplicates()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis will return a new dataframe that contains only unique rows, with the duplicate rows removed. This can be useful for ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis.\n\n'''Short introduction to data visualization'''\nData visualization can be a powerful tool for inspecting data and identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies. It allows you to quickly and easily explore the data, and get insights that might not be immediately obvious when looking at the raw data.\nFirst, we start by getting all columns with numerical data by using the select_dtypes method and filtering for in64 and float64:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n# get all numerical data columns\nnumeric_columns = data.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64'])\nprint(numeric_columns.shape)\n# Print the numerical columns\nprint(numeric_columns)\n\n===Boxplot===\nThey are particularly useful for understanding the range and interquartile range of the data, as well as identifying outliers and comparing data between groups.\nIn the following, we want to plot multiple boxplots using the subplots method and the boxplot method:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n# Create a figure with a grid of subplots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 3, figsize=(15, 15))\n# Iterate over the columns and create a boxplot for each one\nfor i, col in enumerate(numeric_columns.columns):\nax = axs[i \/\/ 3, i % 3]\nax.boxplot(numeric_columns[col])\nax.set_title(col)\n# Adjust the layout and show the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:Boxplot inspection.PNG|centre right]]\n\n===Histogram===\nHistograms are a type of graphical representation that shows the distribution of a dataset.

Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.\n\nNarrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006).","Narrative Research is \"(...) the study of stories\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus \"(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.\" (Moen 2006, p.56). The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014).\n\n'''One common approach in Narrative Research is the usage of narratives in form of spoken or written text or other types of media as the data material for analysis.''' This understanding is comparable to [[Content Analysis]] or [[Hermeneutics]]. A second understanding focuses on the creation of narratives as part of the methodological design, so that the narrative material is not pre-developed but emerges from the inquiry itself (Squire et al. 2014, Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000). In both approaches, 'narrative' is the underlying \"frame of reference\" (Moen 2006, p.57) for the research. An example for the latter understanding is the 'Narrative Interview'.\n\n==== Narrative Interviews ====\n[[File:Narrative Research Phases.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Basic phases of the narrative Interview.''' Source: Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.5.]]\n\nThe Narrative Interview is an Interview format that \"(...) encourages and stimulates an interviewee (...) to tell a story about some significant event in their life and social context.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.3). 'Narrative Interviewing' \"is considered a form of unstructured, in-depth interview with specific features.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.4) To this end, it is a form of the [[Open Interview]], which - compared to [[Semi-structured Interview|Semi-structured]] and [[Survey|Structured Interviews]] - is relatively free from deductively pre-developed question schemata: \"To elicit a less imposed and therefore more 'valid' rendering of the informant's perspective, the influence of the interviewer should be minimal (...) '''The [Narrative Interview] goes further than any other interview method in avoiding pre-structuring the interview.''' (...) It uses a specific type of everyday communication, namely story-telling and listening, to reach this objective.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.4) Here, it is central that the interviewer appreciate the interviewee's perspective, by using the subject's language and by posing \"as someone who knows nothing or very little about the story being told, and who has no particular interests related to it\" (ibid, p.5). The interview is then transcribed and analyzed using different forms of coding (see Content Analysis), with a focus on the narrative elements. For more information on the methodological foundations of conducting and analyzing narrative Interviews, please refer to Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000.","[[File:ConceptNarrativeResearch.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Narrative Research]]]]\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:System|System]] || [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || [[:Category:Future|Future]]\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Narrative Research describes qualitative field research based on narrative formats which are analyzed and\/or created during the research process.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Narrative Research.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Narrative Research until 2020.'''

'Storytelling' is defined as the distinct tonality, format and presentation in which a story is told. The term 'narrative' includes both: the story itself, with its dramaturgy, characters and plot, as well as the act of storytelling (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). However, the term 'narrative' has been used used predominantly as a synonym for 'story' in academia for decades (Barrett & Stauffer 2009).\n\n'''Psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the notion of 'narrative' as being one of two forms of distinct modes of thinking in 1984''' - the other being the 'logico-scientific' mode (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). While the latter is \"(...) more concerned with establishing universal truth conditions\" (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.9), the 'narrative' mode represents the broad human experience of reality. This distinction led to further investigation on the idea that 'narratives' are a central form of human learning about - and [[Glossary|sense-making]] of - the world. Scholars began to recognize the role of analyzing narratives in order to understand individual and societal experiences and the meanings that are attached to these. This led e.g. to the establishment of the field of narrative psychology."],"39":["== The chaos increases ==\nThis brings us now to the second point: what are current models that try to take non-equilibrium dynamics into account? The most simple models are [[Correlations]] and [[Regression Analysis|Regressions]], with 'time' as the independent variable in the case of regressions, or just look at simple temporal correlations concerning temporal dynamics. Since such models either build on linear dynamics of blunt rank statistics, it is clear that such approaches must fail when it comes to taking non-linear dynamics into account. '''Non-equilibrium dynamics are more often than not characterised by non-linear patterns, which need us to step out of the world of linear dynamics.''' \n\nOver the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the patterns that are being modeled. '''In other words, GAMs are able to increase the model fit or predictive power, but in the worst case, we are throwing our means to understand or explain the existing relations out of the window.''' \n\nUnder this spell, over the last decades, parts of the statistical modelling wandered more strongly into the muddy waters of superior model fit, yet understood less and less about the underlying mechanisms. Modern science has to date not sufficiently engaged with the questions how predictive modelling can lead to optimific results, and which role our lack of explicit understanding play in terms of worse outcomes. Preventing a pandemic based on a predictive model is surely good, but enforcing a space shuttle start when there is some lack of understanding of the new conditions at launch day led to the Challenger disaster. '''Many disasters of human history were a lack of understanding the unexpected.''' When our experience was pushed into the new realms of the previously unknown, and our expactation of the likelihood of such an extreme event happening was low, the impending surprise often came at a high price. Many developments - global change, increasing system [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity,]] growing inequalities - may further decrease our ability to anticipate infrequent dynamics. This calls for a shift towards maximizing the resilience of our models that may be needed under future circumstances. While this has been highlighted i.e. by the IPCC, the Stockholm resilience center and many other institutions, policy makers are hardly prepared enough, which became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n== The world can (not) be predicted ==\nFrom a predictive or explanatory viewpoint, we can break the world of statistics down into three basic types of dynamics: Linear dynamics, periodical dynamics, and non-linear dynamics. Let us differentiate between these three.","[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page."],"40":["Poisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

This means that we multiply all integers from K down to 1.

Changing \u03bb means changing the probability of event occurrence in one interval.\n\nFor example, Ladislaus Bortkiewicz calculated the deaths of soldiers by horse kicks in the Prussian Army using Poisson Distribution in the late 1800s. He analyzed two decades of data from up to 10 army corps, equivalent to two centuries of observations for one army corps.\n[[File:Horse.png|center|500px]]\nFigure 1: Poisson Distribution for deaths by horse kick by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz.

However, the deaths were random, for example, in one year four soldiers died and for most years no deaths were caused by horses. Figure 1 shows the probability mass function graph.\nIn Poisson Distribution terms,\n* Death caused by a horse kick is an \u2018event\u2019\n* Mean per time interval, represented by \u03bb, is 0.61\n* The number of deaths by horse kick in a specific year is k.\n\n[[File:Pmf.png|center|500px]]\nFigure 2 is the probability mass function of the Poisson distribution and shows the probability (y-axis) of a number of events (x-axis) occurring in one interval with different rate parameters. You can see the most likely number of event occurrences for a graph is equivalent to its rate parameter (\u03bb) as it is the expected number of events in one interval when it is an integer. When it is not an integer, the number of events with the highest probability would be nearest to \u03bb. The Lamda, \u03bb, also represents the mean and variance of the distribution.\n\n==4.

A converse in Raikov\u2019s theorem says that if the sum of two independent random variables is Poisson distributed, then so are each of those two independent random variables Poisson distributed.\n\nConsider the example of radioactive decay for long-lived isotopes, in a radioactive sample containing a large number of nuclei, each of which has a tiny probability of decaying during some time interval, T.

See the difference between excess kurtosis and kurtosis [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/excesskurtosis.asp here]. In a nutshell, excess kurtosis compares the kurtosis of the distribution with the kurtosis of a normal distribution and can therefore tell you if an (extreme) event is more or less likely in this case than if the distribution followed a normal distribution.\n\n6. Poisson Limit Theorem states that Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, under certain conditions. When the value of n (number of trials) in a binomial distribution is large and the value of p (probability of success) is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution i.e., n -> \u221e and \u03bb = np, rate parameter, \u03bb is defined as the number of trials, n, in binomial distribution multiplied by the probability of success, p.\n\n7. A Poisson distribution with a high mean \u03bb > 20 can be approximated as a normal distribution. However, as normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution, a continuity correction is necessary. It would exceed the scope to discuss in detail here what this correction is. In short, it adds or substracts 0.5 to the value in question to increase the accuracy of the estimation when using a continuous probability approach for something that has discrete probabilities.\nFor example, a factory with 45 accidents per year follows a Poisson distribution. A normal approximation would suggest that the probability of more than 50 accidents can be computed as follows:\n\nMean = \u03bb = \u03bc =45\n\nStandard deviation = \u2202 = \u221a\u03bb = 6.71 P(X>50.5) -> after continuity correction =\n[[File:6 equation.PNG|center]]\nusing Z score table, see more [https:\/\/builtin.com\/data-science\/how-to-use-a-z-table here].","<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 6))\nax.bar(range(len(data)), list(data.values()), align='center')\nplt.xticks(range(len(data)), list(data.keys()))\nplt.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File: plot 1.png|center|700px]]\n\nThe resulting pmf confirms that the closest integer value to lamba i.e., 3 has the most number of years out of 10,000 meaning most years will have 3 duststorms. You can also see that the data is slightly skewed to the right since there is a larger variance to the right than to the left. Looking at the distribution, it looks fairly normally distributed. However, the low lambda does not allow to use the Poisson distribution as an approximation for a normal distribution. Most probably, the large dataset allows us to see it as a normal distribution, since most distributions converge to a normal distribution with increasing sample size.\n==6.

It also works brilliantly when you struggle with starting a task or procrastination in general.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Stay productive\n* Manage time effectively\n* Keep distractions away\n* Stay flexible within your head\n* Avoid losing yourself in details\n\n== Getting started ==\nPomodoro is a method to self-organize, avoid losing yourself, stay productive and energized. \n\n'''Pomodoro is very simple. All you need is work to be done and a timer.'''  \n\nThere are six steps in the technique:\n\n# Decide on the task to be done.\n# Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to ''25 minutes = 1 \"Pomodoro\"'').\n# Work on the task.\n# End work when the timer rings (Optionally: put a checkmark on a piece of paper).\n# If you have fewer than four checkmarks (i.e. done less than 4 Pomodoros) , take a short break (5 minutes), then go back to step 2.\n# After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15\u201330 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then start again at step 1.\n\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\n\n==== Resources ====\n\n* Wikipedia - [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pomodoro_Technique Pomodoro Technique]\n* [https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730 Extensive Description] on Lifehacker\n* [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H0k0TQfZGSc Video description] from Thomas Frank\n\n==== Apps ====\n\n* Best Android App: [https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=net.phlam.android.clockworktomato&hl=de Clockwork Tomato]\n* Best iPhone App: [https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/focus-keeper-time-management\/id867374917 Focus Keeper]\n\n\n__NOTOC__\n----\n[[Category:Skills_and_Tools]]\n[[Category:Productivity Tools]]\n[[Category:Team Size 1]]\n[[Category:Team Size 2-10]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors| author]] of this entry is Matteo Ramin.","{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]]''' || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || [[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]] || [[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]] || [[:Category:Team Size 1|1]] || '''[[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n'''Disney Method is a fairly simple (group) [[Glossary|brainstorming]] technique''' that revolves around the application of different perspectives to any given topic. One person or a group comes up with ideas, then envisions their implementation and finally reflects upon their feasibility in a circular process. The Disney Method may be used to come up with ideas for projects or products, to solve problems and conflicts, to develop strategies and to make decisions. The method was invented by Walt Disney who thought of a movie not only as a director, but also as an audience member and a producer to come up with the best possible result.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Productive brainstorming\n* Understanding for other perspectives\n* Strong team spirit \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe Disney method process is circular. A group of people (ideally five or six) is split into three different roles: the Dreamers, the Realists, the Critics. \n\n[[File:Disney Method.png|450px|thumb|right|The Disney Method process]]\n\nThe '''Dreamers'''...\n* try to come up with new ideas\n* are creative and imaginative and do not set themselves any limits\n* everything is possible!\n* Guiding questions: ''Which ideas come to mind? What would be an ideal solution to the problem?''\n\nThe '''Realists'''...\n* think about what needs to be done to implement the ideas\n* are practical and realistic\n* Guiding Questions: ''How does the idea feel? How could it be implemented? Who should do it and at what cost?''\n\nThe '''Critics'''...\n* look at the idea objectively and try to identify crucial mistakes\n* are critical, but constructive - they do not want to destroy the ideas, but improve them constructively.\n* Guiding Questions: ''What was neglected by the Dreamers and Realists? What can be improved, what will not work? Which risks exist?''\n\nEach role receives a specific area within a room, or even dedicated rooms or locations, that may also be decorated according to the respective role. '''The process starts with the Dreamers, who then pass on their ideas to the Realists, who pass their thoughts on to the Critics.''' Each phase should be approx. 20 minutes long, and each phase is equivalently important. \nAfter one cycle, the Critics pass back the feedback to the ideas to the Dreamers, who continue thinking about new solutions based on the feedback they got. Every participant should switch the role throughout the process (with short breaks to 'neutralize' their minds) in order to understand the other roles' perspectives. The process goes on for as long as it takes, until the Dreamers are happy about the ideas, the Realists are confident about their feasibility and the Critics do not have any more remarks.\n\nA fourth role (the neutral moderator) may be added if the process demands it. He\/she is then responsible for starting and ending the process and moderating the discussions. The method may also be applied by an individual who goes through the process individually.","{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Software|Software]]''' || [[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]] || [[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]] || [[:Category:Team Size 1|1]] || '''[[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\nMiro is an online collaboration tool which allows you to hold virtual workshops, develop common ideas and designs, have a digital workspace or design presentations in a different way.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Work better together online\n* Integrate many different functions (project management, online collaboration, presentation) into one\n\n== Getting started ==\nMiro is an online-tools which allows you to collaborate with others (but also work by yourself).

Even if we only plot the eigenvectors scaled by their eigenvalues, we will basically have a summary data (and its spreading). At this point, the eigenpairs are be viewed as the principle components of the data.\n\n[[File: PCAEigenvector02.png|center|500px]]\n\n==== Ranking the principle components ====\nAs you may have noticed, the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. This is no coincidence. You can think of it this way: because we want to maximize the variance explained by each of the principle components, these components need to be independent from one another, therefore their orthogonality.  Thus, to define a set of principle components, you find the direction which can explain the variability in the data the most: that is your first principle component (the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue). The second principle compent will be percepdicular to the first, and explain most of what is left of the variability. This continues until the d-th principle component is found.\n\nBy doing so, you are also sorting the \"importance\" of the principle components in terms of the information amount it contains what is used to explain the data. To be clear, the sum of all eigenvalues is the total variability in the data. From here, you can choose to discard any PCs whose percentage of explained variances are low. In many cases, if around 80% of the variance can be explained by the first k PCs, we can discard the other (d - k) PCs. Of course, this is only one of the heuristics method to determine k.  You can also use thr elbow method (the scree plot) like in k-means.\n\n==== Summary ====\n* PCA is a feature extraction technique widely used to reduce dimensionality of datasets.\n* PCA works by calculating the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the initial variables in the data. These are the principle components. Number of PCs = number of eigenvectors = number of features.\n* The PCs are ranked by the eigenvalues, and iteratively show the directions in which the data spreads the most (after accounting for the previous PCs).\n* We can choose to keep a few of the first PCs that cummulatively explains the data well enough, and these are the new reduced dimension of the data.\n* Standardization is a crucial step in data pre-processing to ensure the validity of the PCA results.\n\n\n=== R Example ===\nGoing back to the example in the introduction, the dataset can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sdhilip\/nutrient-analysis-of-pizzas\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For pre-processing data\nlibrary(factoextra) # For visualization\ntheme_set(theme_bw()) # Set theme for plots\n\n# Load data\ndata <- read_csv(\"Pizza.csv\")\nhead(data)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nAs shown here, there are seven measurements of nutrients for each pizza. Our goal is to reduce these seven dimensions of information down to only two, so that we can present the main patterns in our data on a flat piece of paper.\n\nTo conduct Principle Component Analysis in R, we use <code>prcomp<\/code>. From the original data, we only select the seven nutrient measurements as input for the function. In this function, we set <code>scale = TRUE<\/code> to perform scaling and centering (so that all variables will have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1). The result object is saved in <code>data.pca<\/code>","== What the method does ==\nPrinciple Component Analysis is one of the foundational methods to combat the curse of dimensionality. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm whose goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, condensing its entirety down to a low number of dimensions (also called principle components, usually two or three). \n\nAlthough it comes with a cost of losing some information, it makes data visualization much easier, improves the space and time complexity required for machine learning algorithms tremendously, and allows for more intuitive intepretation of these models. PCA can also be categorized a feature extraction techniques, since it creates these principle components - new and more relevant features - from the original ones.\n\nThe essence of PCA lies in finding all directions in which the data \"spreads\", determining the extent in which the data spreads in those directions, keeping only few direction in which the data spreads the most. And voila, these are your new dimensions \/ features of the data.\n\n=== Road to PCA ===\n==== Standardization ====\nOftentimes the features in the data are measured on different scales. This step makes sure that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Otherwise, variables with large range will trump thoses with smaller range (for example: a time variable that ranges between 0ms and 1000ms with dominate over a distance variable that ranges between 0m and 10m). Each variable can be scaled by subtracting its mean and dividing by the standard deviation (this is the same as calculating the z-score, and in the end, all variables with have the same mean 0 and standard deviation of 1).\n\n==== Covariance matrix ====\n\nThe covariance matrix is a square d x d matrix, where each entry represents the covariance of a possible pair of the original features. It has the following properties:\n* The size of the matrix is equal to the number of features in the data\n* The main diagonal on the matrix contains the variances of each initial variables.\n* The matrix is symmetric, since Cov(d1, d2) = Cov(d1, d2)\n\nThe covariance matrix gives you a summary of the relationship among the initial variables.\n* A positive value indicate a directly proportional relationship (as d1 increases, d2 increases, and vice versa)\n* A negative value indicate a indirectly proportional relationship (as d1 increases, d2 decreases, and vice versa)\n\n==== Eigenvectors \/ Principle Components & Eigenvalues ====\nNow we have the covariance matrix. This matrix can be used to transform one vector into another. Normally when this transformation happens, two things happen: the original is  rotated and get streched\/squished to form a new vector. When an abitrary vector is multipled by the covariance matrix, the result will be a new vector whose direction is nudged\/rotated towards the greatest spread in the data. In the figure below, we start with the arbitrary vector (-1, 0.5) in red. Multiplying the red vector with covariance matrix gives us the blue vector, and repeating this gives us the black vector. As you can see, the result rotation tends to converge towards the widest spread direction of the data.\n\n[[File: PCAEigenvector01.png|center|500px]]\n\nThis prompts the questions: Can we find directly find the vector which already lies on this \"widest spread direction\". The answer is yes, with the help of eigenvectors. Simply put, an eigenvectors of a certain matrix is a vector that, when transformed by the matrix, does not rotate. It remains on its own span, and the only thing that changes is its magnitude. This (constant) change ratio in magnitude corresponding to each eigenvector is called eigenvalue. It indicates how much of the data variability can be explained by its eigenvector.","Instead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis."],"43":["Secondly, we want to figure out the correlation between variables and most importantly to figure out heteroscedastic and homoscedastic dispersion, since the OLS is only apt when homoscedasticity is the case.\n\nTo analyse this data, some python libraries have to be imported:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport pandas as pd ## to organize data\nimport numpy as np ## to make mathematical computations\nimport statsmodels.api as sm ## needed for statistial anaysis\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf ## needed to write more complex statistical models\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## to make plots\nimport seaborn as sns ## for visualization\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols ## to use OLS\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing ## needed for regression analysis\nfrom statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan ## for checking your multiple regression model\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Data Inspection===\nData inspection is made to check if the data is clean for better graphical performance. The cleaning involves checking for missing values and the data format. The dataset is randomly generated based on a few cornerstone observations from an actual data science class.

Our columns where we wish to make a quantitative analysis should be int64 (without decimal components) or float64 (with decimal components), but id can be ignored since it is only an individual signifier. The variables with the \"object\" data format can contain several data formats. However, looking at the three variables, we can see that they are in a categorical data format, having the categories for gender, whether one passed an exam or not, and the category of the different study groups. These categorical variables cannot be used for a regression analysis as the other variables since we cannot analyze an increase in one unit of this variables and its effect on the dependent variable. Instead, we can see how belonging to one of the categories affects the independent variable. For \"sex\" and \"passed\", these are dummy variables. Columns we will treat as dummy variables can take categories in binary format. We can then for example see if and how being female impacts the dependent variable.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.describe()## here you can an overview over the standard descriptive data.\n<\/syntaxhighlight> \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.columns #This command shows you the variables you will be able to use. The data type is object, since it contains different data formats.\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Homoscedasticity and Heteroscedasticity==\nBefore conducting a regression analysis, it is important to look at the variance of the residuals. In this case, the term \u2018residual\u2019 refers to the difference between observed and predicted data (Dheeraja V.2022).\n\nIf the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore. This does not mean that your results are biased, it only means that another approach can create a linear regression that more adequately models the actual trend in the data. In most cases, you can transform the data in a way that the OLS mechanics function again.\nTo find out if either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity is the case, we can look at the data with the help of different visualization approaches.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"sex\") ## creates a pairplot with a matrix of each variable on the y- and x-axis, but gender, which is colored in orange (hue= \"sex\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored of the final written exam, exercise and number of solved questions among males and females (gender group).\n\nLooking a the graphs along the diagonal line, it shows a higher peak among the male students than the female students for the written exam, solved question (quanti) and exercise points (points). Looking at the relationship between exam and points, no clear pattern can be identified. Therefore, it cannot be safely assumed, that a heteroscedastic dispersion is given.\n[[File:Pic 1.png|700px]]\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"group\", diag_kind=\"hist\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored in the final written exam, for the exercises and number of solved questions solved among the learning groups A,B and C.","Next, we should test for heteroscedasticity. In our regression model, we have assumed homoscedasticity which means that the variance of the residuals is equally distributed. The residuals are the difference between your observations from your predictions.\nIf this is not the case, you have heteroscedasticity. This is often the case because of outliers or skewness in the distribution of a variable. You can assess this visually by plotting the variance of your residuals against an independent variable. Again here, this only makes sense for continuous variables, which is why we look at GCPA.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n# Calculate the residuals\nresiduals = model.resid\n\n# Calculate the squared residuals ( to only have positive values)\nsquared_resid = residuals ** 2\n\n# Group the squared residuals by the values of each independent variable\ngrouped_resid = squared_resid.groupby(x['CGPA'])\n\n# Calculate the variance of the squared residuals for each group\nvar_resid = grouped_resid.var()\n\n# Plot the variance of the squared residuals against the values of each independent variable\nplt.scatter(var_resid.index, var_resid.values)\nplt.xlabel('CGPA')\nplt.ylabel('Variance of Squared Residuals')\nplt.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nWe can see that there are some outliers that might cause heteroscedasticity. We can also check this with the Breusch-Pagan test. \nIf the p-value is lower than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we need to reject the null hypothesis that we have homoscedasticity.\nWe would then treat the model to be heteroscedastic.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n##create the multiple regression model\nx = df[[\"CGPA\"]]\nx = sm.add_constant(x) \ny = df[\"Chance of Admit \"]\n\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, x).fit()\n\n# perform the Breusch-Pagan test\nbp_test = het_breuschpagan(model.resid, model.model.exog)\n\n# print the results\nprint(\"Breusch-Pagan test p-value:\", bp_test[1])\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe test shows that we need to reject the assumption of homoscedasticity. We assume heteroscedasticity. \nBefore we adapt the model, we should also check for serial correlation.\nSerial correlation is the case in which error terms across time or observations are correlated (in our case across observations).\nIf we look at our regression output again, we can check for this using the Durbin-Watson test statistic. Generally speaking, if the \nvalue is around 2, there is no serial correlation, if it is 0, there is a perfect positive serial correlation, if it is 4, there is a perfect\nnegative correlation. The exact values for the number of independent variables and observations you can find [https:\/\/real-statistics.com\/statistics-tables\/durbin-watson-table\/ here]. Our Durbin-Watson\ntest value is 0.839 and we therefore have reason to assume a positive serial correlation. We therefore need to correct for this telling \nthat there is serial correlation (covariance type of H3).\n\n## Now, we need to correct for heteroscedasticity and serial correlation\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nx = df[[\"CGPA\", \"Research\"]]\nx = sm.add_constant(x) \ny = df[\"Chance of Admit \"]\n\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, x)\n\nnw_model = model.fit(cov_type='HAC', cov_kwds={'maxlags': 20})\n\n# print the results\nprint(nw_model.summary())\n<\/syntaxhighlight>"],"44":["(5) Amer, M.

The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were \"(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]\" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).\n\n'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2).","Today, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nScenario Planning is the systematic development of descriptions of (typically multiple) plausible futures, which are then called \"scenarios\". These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them \"(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all \"fundamentally different\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios \"(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).\n\n'''There is no ''one'' procedure for Scenario Planning''' (5). A commonly cited approach by Schoemaker (2, 3) includes the following steps:<br>\n1) Definition of time frame, scope, decision variables and major actors of the issue in question.\n\n2) Identification of current trends and predetermined elements and how they influence the defined decision variables, based on the knowledge of experts and the available data. It should be observed whether major trends are compatible with each other and which uncertainties exist. \n\n3) Construction of extreme future states along a specific continuum (positive vs negative, probable vs surprising, continuous vs divergent etc.) for all the elements or variables. These extremes are then assessed for their internal consistency and plausibility in terms of stakeholder decisions, trends and outcomes.\n\n4) Elimination of implausible or impossible futures and, based on the themes that emerged from these, the creation of new scenarios. This process is repeatedly done until internally consistent scenarios are found. The number of scenarios developed depends on the scope and purpose of the planning process (1, 5).\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Process.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Evaluation of the number of scenarios developed.''' Source: Amer et al. 2013. p.33]]\n\n5) The preliminary scenarios are analysed in terms of which decisions would need to be taken by the key stakeholders to reach them, and potentially revised again when further investigation of these scenarios brings up additional or contradictory knowledge about them. The scenarios may also be transferred into quantitative models to learn about the development and inherent uncertainties of individual variables.\n\n6) Finally, these preliminary scenarios are re-iterated by going through the previous steps again, checking for their applicability to the issue at hand, until finally, scenarios emerge that can be used for planning processes.\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Example.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Exemplary scenarios for life in Australian cities.'''

Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.'''

His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued \"against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|'''Moreno's original work on Social Networks.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]\n\nRomanian-American psychosociologist '''Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s''' with his - and his collaborator Helen Jennings' - 'sociometry', which served \"(...) as a way of conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction.\" (Scott 1988, p.110). Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).","[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.894]]\n\nThe Social Network Analyst then analyzes these relations \"(...) for structural patterns that emerge among these actors. Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3). Surrounding actors may provide leverage or influence that affect the agent's actions (Borgatti et al. 2009)"],"46":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Stacked Area plots.

A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

This entry helps visualise two different types of stacked bar plots, ''Simple Stacked Plots'' and ''Proportions Stacked Plots'', and explains the difference between them. For more on the basics of barplots, please refer to the [[Barplots, Histograms and Boxplots]] entry.\n\n\n==Stacked Barplots: Proportions vs. Absolute Values==\nStacked bar plots show the quantitative relationship that exists between a main category and its subcategories. Each bar represents a principal category and it is divided into segments representing subcategories of a second categorical variable. The chart shows not only the quantitative relationship between the different subcategories with each other but also with the main category as a whole. They are also used to show how the composition of the subcategories changes over time.\n\nStacked bar plots should be used for Comparisons and Proportions but with emphasis on Composition. This composition analysis can be static for a certain moment in time, or dynamic for a determined period of time.\n\nStacked bar Plots are two-dimensional with two axes: one axis shows categories, the other axis shows numerical values. The axis where the categories are indicated does not have a scale (*) to highlight that it refers to discrete (mutually exclusive) groups. The axis with numerical values must have a scale with its corresponding measurements units.\n\n\n===When you should use a stacked bar plot===\nThe main objective of a standard bar chart is to compare numeric values between levels of a categorical variable. One bar is plotted for each level of the categorical variable, each bar\u2019s length indicating numeric value. A stacked bar chart also achieves this objective, but also targets a second goal.\n\nWe want to move to a stacked bar chart when we care about the relative decomposition of each primary bar based on the levels of a second categorical variable. Each bar is now comprised of a number of sub-bars, each one corresponding with a level of a secondary categorical variable. The total length of each stacked bar is the same as before, but now we can see how the secondary groups contributed to that total.\n\n\n==Two types of Stacked Barplots==\n1. '''Simple Stacked Plots'''\u00a0place the\u00a0'''absolute value'''\u00a0of each subcategory after or over the previous one. The numerical axis has a scale of numerical values. The graph shows the absolute value of each subcategory and the sum of these values indicates the total for the category. Usually, the principal bars have different final heights or lengths.\n   \nWe use simple stacked plots when relative and absolute differences matter.

Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word \"experiment\" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.  \n\nThe easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a \"What if\" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers of variations of this experiment exist (see Further Information), as it can teach much about choice, ethics, and responsibility. For instance, many people would change the train direction, but hardly anyone would push a person onto the track to derail the train. This would save the other five, and the outcome would be the same. However the difference between pushing a lever or pushing a person has deep psychological ramifications that resolve around guilt. This exemplifies that the Thought Experiment does not necessarily have a ''best'' outcome, as the outcome depends - in this example - on your moral choices. Some might argue that you should hurl yourself onto the track to stop the train, thereby not changing the countable outcome, but performing a deeply altruistic act that saves everybody else. Most people would probably be unable to do this. \n\n'''Such deeply normative Thought Experiments differ from Thought Experiments that resolve around the natural world.''' Dropping a feather and a stone from a high building is such an example, as this experiment is clearly not normative. We are all aware that the air would prevent the feather to fall as fast as the stone. What if we take the air now out of the experiment, and let both fall in a vacuum. Such a Thought Experiment is prominent in physics and exemplifies the great flexibility of this method. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat was another example of the Thought Experiment, where quantum states and uncertainty are illustrated by a cat that is either dead or not, which depends on the decay of some radioactive element. Since radioactive decay rates are not continuous, but represent a sudden change, the cat could be dead or not. The cat is dead and not dead at the same time. Many argue that this is a paradox, and I would follow this assumption with the supporting argument that we basically look at two realities at the same time. This exemplifies again that our interpretation of this Thought Experiment can also be normative, since a definitive proof of my interpretation is very difficult. This is insofar relevant, as seemingly all Thought Experiments are still based on subjective realisations and inferences. \n\n[[File:Schr\u00f6dingers Cat.png|400px|thumb|left|'''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.''' Source: [https:\/\/ad4group.com\/schrodingers-cat-and-the-marketing-strategy\/ AD4Group].]]","== Strengths and Challenges ==\nThe core strengths of Thought Experiments is to raise normative assumptions of about the world, and about the future. Thought Experiments can thus unleash a transformative potential within individuals, as people question the status quo in their norms and morals. Another strength of Thought Experiments is the possibility to consider different futures, as well as alternatives of the past. Thought Experiments are thus as versatile and flexible as people's actions or decision, and the ''What if'' of Thought Experiments allows us to re-design our world and make deep inquiries into alternative state of the world. This makes Thought Experiments potentially time-saving, and also resource-efficient. If we do not need to test our assumptions in the real world, our work may become more efficient, and we may even be able to test assumptions that would be unethical in the real world. '''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat experiment is purely theoretical, and thus not only important for physics, but also better for the cat.''' This latest strength is equally also the greatest weakness of Thought Experiments. We might consider all different option about alternative states of the world, yet we have to acknowledge that humankind has a long history of being wrong in terms of our assumptions about the world. In other words, while Thought Experiments are so fantastic because they can be unburdened by reality, this automatically means that they are also potentially different from reality. Another potential flaw of Thought Experiments is that they are only as good as our assumptions and reflections about the world. A four-year-old making up theThought Experiment \"What if I have an unlimited amount of ice cream?\" would consequently drown or freeze in the unlimited amount of ice cream. Four-year-olds are not aware of the danger of the \"unlimited\", and may not be the best Thought Experimenters. The same holds true for many other people, and just as our norms and values change, the value of specific Thought Experiments can change over time. Thought Experiments are like a reflection, and any reflection can be blurry, partly, bended, or plain wrong - the last case, if we cannot identify our reflection in the mirror of Thought Experiments.\n\n== Normativity ==\nThought experiments are as we have already learned as normative as are our assumptions about the world. Hume argued that Thought Experiments are based on the laws of nature, yet here I would disagree. While many famous Thought Experiments are about the physical world, others are only made up in our minds. Many Thought Experiments are downright impossible to be matched with our reality, and are even explicitly designed to do this, such as Thomas Nagels Encyclopaedia of the Universe. It is therefore important to realise that basically all Thought Experiments are in essence normative, and one could say even downright subjective. Building on Derek Parfit, I would however propose a different interpretation, and propose that we should not measure the normativity of Thought Experiments through the design and setting, but instead by their outcome. Many people might come to the same conclusions within a given Thought Experiment, and some conclusion drawn from Thought Experiments may matter more than others. Consequently the penultimate question - also for Derek Parfit - is whether there are some Thought Experiments that are not normative.","[[File:Thought Experiment Concept Visualisation.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Thought Experiments]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n| [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Thought Experiments are systematic speculations that allow to explore modifications, manipulations or completly new states of the world.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Scopus hits Thought Experiment.png|450px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Thought Experiments until 2019.'''

The consideration of potential futures was a vital step when our distant ancestors emancipated themselves and became humans. Asking themselves the ''What if'' questions was a vital step in the dawn of humankind, and both in the West and the East many of the first thinkers are known to have engaged in Thought Experiments. Methodologically, Thought Experiments provide a link between the metaphysical - or philosophy - and the natural world - i.e. natural sciences. Ancient Greece as well as Buddhism and Hinduism are full of early examples of Thought Experiments. Aristoteles remains a first vital step in the West, and after a long but slow growth of the importance of the methods, he represents a bridge into the early [[History of Methods|enlightenment]]. Galileo and Newton are early examples of famous Thought Experiments that connect theoretical considerations with a systematic reflection of the natural world. This generation of more generalisable laws was more transgressed with the ''Origin of Species'' by Charles Darwin. This theory was initially one epic Thought Experiment, and although DNA initially confirmed it, the role of epigenetics was another step that proved rather problematic for Darwinism. Mach introduced the term \"Thought Experiment\", and Lichtenberg created a more systematic exploration of thought experiments. Many ethical Thought Experiments gained province in the 20st century, and Derek Parfit is a prominent example how these experiments are used to illustrate and argument cases and examples within ethics."],"48":["THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE\n==What is Time Series Data==\nTime series data is a sequence of data points collected at regular intervals of time. It often occurs in fields like engineering, finance, or economics to analyze trends and patterns over time. Time series data is typically numeric data, for example, the stock price of a specific stock, sampled at an hourly interval, over a time frame of several months. It could also be sensory data from a fitness tracker, sampling the heart rate every 30 seconds, or a GPS track of the last run.\nIn this article, we will see examples from a household energy consumption dataset having data for longer than a year, obtained from [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets\/jaganadhg\/house-hold-energy-data Kaggle] (Download date: 20.12.2022). \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport numpy as np ## to prepare your data\nimport pandas as pd ## to prepare your data\nimport plotly.express as px ## to visualize your data\nimport os ## to set your working directory\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is important to check which folder Python believes to be working in.

There are multiple approaches to detecting and dealing with outliers in time series data. We will have a look at detecting outliers first: 1. Distribution-based outlier detection: This detection method relies on the assumption that the data follows a certain known distribution. Then all points outside this distribution are considered outliers. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 2. Distance-based outlier detection: This method computes the distance from one point to all other points. A point is considered \u201cclose\u201d to another point when the distance between them is below a set threshold. Then, a point is considered an outlier if the fraction of points deemed close to that point is below a threshold. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 3. Local outlier factor (LOF): The local outlier factor (LOF) is a measure of how anomalous an object is within a dataset, based on the density of its local neighborhood. The LOF is computed by comparing the density of an object's neighborhood to the densities of the neighborhoods of its nearest neighbors. If the density of an object's neighborhood is significantly lower than the densities of its neighbors' neighborhoods, then it is considered an outlier (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n1. is best to use when you have an idea of the distribution of your data, ideally if the data is normally distributed. This is especially the case for very large datasets.\n\n2. Is best when you expect outliers spread across the distribution, but you don't know the distribution.\n\n3. Is best when you want to identify outliers in clusters or in varying densities because you compare the data points to their neighbors. To decide, you can assess the distribution visually. For a better overview of the different approaches to handling outliers in general, see [[Outlier_Detection_in_Python|here]].\nIn general, many outlier detection methods are available ready-to-use in numerous python packages. This is an example of using the local outlier factor from the package scikit-learn:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports the necessary packages for visualization.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor ## imports the function for the local outlier function","== Key Publications ==\n* Russell, S., & Norvig, P.

Zun\u00e4chst wurden Fische in die \u00d6kosysteme eingef\u00fchrt und die nachfolgende Populationsdynamik qualitativ und quantitativ gemessen, vieles davon gemeinsam mit den kooperierenden Anglern (\"Kooperation\"). Zweitens wurden die Angler*innen \u00fcber die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Fischpopulationen und ihre wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen befragt (''Konsultation''), bevor die Daten mit Hilfe von monet\u00e4ren Modellen analysiert wurden. Drittens wurden Entscheidungsprozesse auf der Grundlage von Gespr\u00e4chen mit den Angler*innen modelliert und ihre mentalen Modelle \u00fcber das Angeln ausgewertet (''Konsultation''). Viertens wurden partizipative Workshops durchgef\u00fchrt, um die Angler bei der Optimierung ihrer Fischgr\u00fcnde zu unterst\u00fctzen (''Empowerment''). F\u00fcnftens wurden auf der Grundlage der bisherigen empirischen Ergebnisse sozial-\u00f6kologische Modelle entwickelt (''Konsultation''). Zuletzt werden die Projektergebnisse in verschiedenen Medien f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Zielgruppen ver\u00f6ffentlicht (''Information'').","'''1) Neue Methoden erfinden'''\nNeue Methoden zu erfinden klingt sicherlich aufregend. Es gibt eine ganze Welt des Wissens, die auf uns wartet, und neue Methoden k\u00f6nnten potenziell in der Lage sein, dieses neue Wissen zu erschlie\u00dfen. Trotz des Geistes, der viele Forschenden zu diesem Ziel motiviert, m\u00f6chte ich hervorheben, dass in der Vergangenheit die Erfindung neuer Methoden oft aus der klaren Erkenntnis eines Mangels an Methoden zur L\u00f6sung eines bestimmten Problems entstand. Die Vorschl\u00e4ge des Interviews als wissenschaftliche Methode oder der [[Grounded Theory]] wurzelten in der Erkenntnis eines Mangels an einem geeigneten methodischen Ansatz f\u00fcr ein spezifisches Problem. Als Beispiel seien hier [[Open Interview|offene Interviews]] genannt, die ein induktives Verst\u00e4ndnis der Wahrnehmungen von Individuen erm\u00f6glichten. Diese Art der Erkenntnis als solche gab es vorher nicht, und durch den Vorschlag dieser neuen Methoden konnte eine L\u00fccke geschlossen werden. Um diese L\u00fccke zu schlie\u00dfen, musste meiner Meinung nach diese L\u00fccke erkannt werden, was auf dem Erkennen von klarem Wissen und Erfahrungen mit Methoden, die bereits vorhanden waren, beruhte. \n\nNehmen wir zum Beispiel auch Fischers Varianzanalyse, die im Grunde genommen die Durchf\u00fchrung systematischer [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|Experimente]] auf eine v\u00f6llig neue Ebene brachte. Fischer sah die bestehende Forschung an dem landwirtschaftlichen Forschungszentrum, an dem er als Statistiker arbeitete, und er sah einen klaren Mangel an einer systematischen Methode, die es erlaubte, Wissen im Sinne von Mustererkennung basierend auf der Pr\u00fcfung einer vorherrschenden Hypothese zu generieren. Fischer kannte den Stand der Technik, und er erkannte eine deutliche L\u00fccke im Kanon der vorhandenen Methoden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hatte er Erfahrung mit den bereits existierenden Methoden, was eine Voraussetzung f\u00fcr seine Formulierung der Varianzanalyse war. Die Erfindung neuer Methoden ist also durchaus ein allm\u00e4hlicher Prozess in einer kontinuierlichen Entwicklung, auch wenn Wissenschaftshistoriker*innen sie oft auf einen einzelnen Zeitpunkt reduzieren. Ich schlage daher vor, eher ein Kontinuum anzuerkennen, in dem solche neuen Methoden vorgeschlagen werden. Solche innovativen Einstellungen bauen typischerweise auf der Erfahrung mit bestehenden Methoden auf, und damit auf der Erkenntnis einer L\u00fccke innerhalb der bereits existierenden Methoden, oder besser noch, auf dem Wissen, das diese Methoden produzieren k\u00f6nnen."]},"context_precision":{"0":0.0609756098,"1":0.0133333333,"2":0.0989010989,"3":0.0,"4":0.1009174312,"5":0.1222222222,"6":0.0083333333,"7":0.0166666667,"8":0.0083333333,"9":0.0550458716,"10":0.0084745763,"11":0.1621621622,"12":0.0260869565,"13":0.0357142857,"14":0.0396825397,"15":0.0956521739,"16":0.007751938,"17":0.2112676056,"18":0.0365853659,"19":0.0105263158,"20":0.2058823529,"21":0.0989010989,"22":0.0952380952,"23":0.1369863014,"24":0.0305343511,"25":0.0784313725,"26":0.0084033613,"27":0.0625,"28":0.1392405063,"29":0.0481927711,"30":0.0602409639,"31":0.1238938053,"32":0.0405405405,"33":0.0126582278,"34":0.0253164557,"35":0.0759493671,"36":0.0275229358,"37":0.0731707317,"38":0.0163934426,"39":0.1058823529,"40":0.0098039216,"41":0.0731707317,"42":0.0619469027,"43":0.0063694268,"44":0.0506329114,"45":0.0204081633,"46":0.0092592593,"47":0.2087912088,"48":0.0,"49":0.175},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"2":0.0,"3":0.0,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":1.0,"10":0.25,"11":0.5,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":0.5555555556,"19":1.0,"20":0.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.3333333333,"25":1.0,"26":0.5,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":0.4949494949,"30":1.0,"31":1.0,"32":0.1666666667,"33":1.0,"34":0.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"38":1.0,"39":0.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"43":0.3636363636,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":0.0,"47":1.0,"48":0.0,"49":1.0}}
