0|What is the advantage of A/B testing?|The advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process.|"['\'\'\'THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE\'\'\'\n==A/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content. This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A/B tests, the scheme of [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|scientific experiments]] is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.\n\n==Planning Phase==\nDuring the planning phase, a goal and hypothesis are formulated, and a study design is developed that specifies the sample size, the duration of the study, and the metrics to be measured. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of the test.\n\n===Goal Definition===\nThe goal identifies problems or optimization potential to improve the software product. For example, in the case of a website, the goal could be to increase newsletter subscriptions or improve the conversion rate through changing parts of the website.\n\n===Hypotheses Formulation===\nTo determine if a particular change is better than the default version, a two-sample hypothesis test is conducted to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the two samples (version A and B). This involves stating the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n\nFrom the perspective of an A/B test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the control and treatment group, while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the two groups which is influenced by a non-random cause.\n\nIn most cases, it is not known a priori whether the discrepancy in the results between A and B is in favor of A or B. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis should consider the possibility that both versions A and B have different levels of efficiency. In order to account for this, a two-sided test is typically preferred for the subsequent evaluation.\n\n\'\'\'For example:\'\'\'\n\n""To fix the problem that there are hardly any subscriptions for my newsletter, I will put the sign-up box higher up on the website.""\n\nGoal: Increase the newsletter subscriptions on the website.\n\nH0: There are no significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\nH1: There are significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\n===Minimizing Confounding Variables===\nIn order to obtain accurate results, it is important to minimize confounding variables before the A/B test is conducted. This involves determining an appropriate sample size, tracking the right users, collecting the right metrics, and ensuring that the randomization unit is adequate.\n\nThe sample size is determined by the percentage of users included in the test variants (control and treatment) and the duration of the experiment. As the experiment runs for a longer period of time, more visitors are exposed to the variants, resulting in an increase in the sample size. Because many external factors vary over time, it is important to randomize over time by running the control and treatment variants simultaneously at a fixed percentage throughout the experiment. Thereby the goal is to obtain adequate statistical power, where the statistical power of an experiment is the probability of detecting a particular effect if it exists. In practice, one can assign any percentages to the control and treatment, but 50% gives the experiment maximum statistical power.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to analyze only the subset of the population/users that were potentially affected. For example, in an A/B test aimed at optimizing newsletter subscriptions, it would be appropriate to exclude individuals who were already subscribed to the newsletter, as they would not have been affected by the changes made to the subscription form.\n\nAdditionally, the metrics used in the experiment should be carefully chosen based on their relevance to the hypotheses being tested. For example, in the case of an e-commerce site, metrics such as newsletter subscriptions and revenue per user may be of interest, as they are directly related to the goal of the test. However, it is important to avoid considering too many metrics at once, as this can increase the risk of miscorrelation.\n\n==Execution Phase==\nThe execution phase involves implementing the study design, collecting data, and monitoring the study to ensure it is conducted according to the plan. During this phase, users are randomly assigned to the control or treatment group ensuring that the study is conducted in a controlled and unbiased manner.\n\n==Evaluation Phase==\nThe evaluation phase involves analyzing the data collected during the study and interpreting the results. This phase is crucial for determining the statistical significance of the results and drawing valid conclusions about whether there was a statistical significant difference between the treatment group and the control group. One commonly used method is calculating the [[Designing_studies#P-value|p-value]] of the statistical test, or by using [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes\' theorem] calculating the probability that the treatment had a positive effect based on the observed data and the prior beliefs about the treatment.']"|0.2222222222222222|0.0
1|What is the ANOVA a powerful for?|Reducing variance in field experiments or complex laboratory experiments|"[""====Analysis of Variance====\n'''The [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anova.asp ANOVA] is one key analysis tool of [[Experiments|laboratory experiments]]''' - but also other experiments as we shall see later. This statistical test is - mechanically speaking - comparing the means of more than two groups by extending the restriction of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Two_sample_t-test|t-test]]. Comparing different groups became thus a highly important procedure in the design of experiments, which is, apart from laboratories, also highly relevant in greenhouse experiments in ecology, where conditions are kept stable through a controlled environment. \n\nThe general principle of the ANOVA is rooted in [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. An idealized null hypothesis is formulated against which the data is being tested. If the ANOVA gives a significant result, then the null hypothesis is rejected, hence it is statistically unlikely that the data confirms the null hypothesis. As one gets an overall p-value, it can be thus confirmed whether the different groups differ overall. Furthermore, the ANOVA allows for a measure beyond the p-value through the '''sum of squares calculations''' which derive how much is explained by the data, and how large in relation the residual or unexplained information is.\n\n====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes. Since a non-normal distribution may influence the outcome of the test, boxplots are a helpful visual aid, as these allow for a simple detection tool of non-normal distribution levels. \n\nEqually should ideally the variance be comparable across all levels, which is called '''[https://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia homoscedastic]'''. What is also important is the criteria of '''independence''', meaning that samples of factor levels should not influence each other. For this reason are for instance in ecological experiments plants typically planted in individual pots. In addition does the classical ANOVA assume a '''balanced design''', which means that all factor levels have an equal sample size. If some factor levels have less samples than others, this might pose interactions in terms of normals distribution and variance, but there is another effect at play. Larger sample sizes on one factor level may create a disbalance, where factor levels with larger samples pose a larger influence on the overall model result. \n\n====One way and two way ANOVA====\nSingle factor analysis that are also called '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvAMVY2cmok one-way ANOVAs]' investigate one factor variable, and all other variables are kept constant. Depending on the number of factor levels these demand a so called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square randomisation], which is necessary to compensate for instance for microclimatic differences under lab conditions.\n\nDesigns with multiple factors or '[https://www.thoughtco.com/analysis-of-variance-anova-3026693 two way ANOVAs]' test for two or more factors, which then demands to test for interactions as well. This increases the necessary sample size on a multiplicatory scale, and the degrees of freedoms may dramatically increase depending on the number of factors levels and their interactions. An example of such an interaction effect might be an experiment where the effects of different watering levels and different amounts of fertiliser on plant growth are measured. While both increased water levels and higher amounts of fertiliser right increase plant growths slightly, the increase of of both factors jointly might lead to a dramatic increase of plant growth.\n\n====Interpretation of ANOVA====\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-15 um 14.13.34.png|thumb|These boxplots are from the R dataset ToothGrowth. The boxplots which you can see here differ significantly.]]\nBoxplots provide a first visual clue to whether certain factor levels might be significantly different within an ANOVA analysis. If one box within a boxplot is higher or lower than the median of another factor level, then this is a good rule of thumb whether there is a significant difference. When making such a graphically informed assumption, we have to be however really careful if the data is normally distributed, as skewed distributions might tinker with this rule of thumb. The overarching guideline for the ANOVA are thus the p-values, which give significance regarding the difference between the different factor levels. \n\nIt can however also be relevant to compare the difference between specific groups, which is made by a '''[https://www.statisticshowto.com/post-hoc/ posthoc test]'''. A prominent example is the [https://sciencing.com/what-is-the-tukey-hsd-test-12751748.html Tukey Test], where two factor levels are compared, and this is done iteratively for all factor level combinations. Since this poses a problem of multiple testing, there is a demand for a [https://www.statisticshowto.com/post-hoc/ Bonferonni correction] to adjust the p-value. Mechanically speaking, this is comparable to conducting several t-tests between two factor level combinations, and adjusting the p-values to consider the effects of multiple testing.""]"|0.37142857142857144|0.0
2|What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to probability, and how have they influenced modern science?|Thomas Bayes introduced a different approach to probability that relied on small or imperfect samples for statistical inference. Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent opposite ends of the spectrum, with frequentist methods requiring specific conditions like sample size and a normal distribution, while Bayesian methods work with existing data.|"[""== Normativity ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. Just like the examples presented above, this has several flipsides of the same coin.\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances. Especially for predictive modeling and small data problems, Bayesian approaches should be preferred, as well as for tough cases that defy the standard array of statistical distributions. Let us hope for a future where we surely know how to toss a coin. For more on this, please refer to the entry on [[Non-equilibrium dynamics]].\n\n== Outlook ==\nBayesian methods have been central in a variety of domains where outcomes are probabilistic in nature; fields such as engineering, medicine, finance, etc. heavily rely on Bayesian methods to make forecasts. Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Bayes, T. 1997.

3|Why is acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law challenging in the contexts of agency?|Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging in the contexts of agency because lucky or unlucky actions that were not anticipated by the agents are not included in the definition of agency.|"[""What is however clear is that the three concepts - agency, complexity and emergence - have consequences about our premises of empirical knowledge. What if ultimately nothing is generalisable? What if all valid arguments are only valid for a certain time? And what if some strata will forever escape a truly reliable measurement? We [[Big problems for later|cannot answer]] these problems here, yet it is important to differentiate what we know, what we may be able to know, and what we will probably never know. The [https://www.britannica.com/science/uncertainty-principle uncertainty principle of Heisenberg] in Quantum mechanics which refers to the the position and momentum of particles illustrates that some things cannot be approximated, observed or known. Equal claims can be made about larger phenomena, such as personal identity. Hence, as much as agency, complex systems and emergence can be boundary objects for methods, they equally highlight our (current) limitations.\n\n\n== The way forward ==\nIf we want to empirically investigate agency, we first and foremost investigate individuals, or actions of entities we consider as non-variable, or consequences of actions of individuals. All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.''' Because of this, much of our current knowledge of agency is either rooted in widely deductive experimental settings or the testing of very clear hypotheses, or questions of either logic or metaphysics, which are widely associated with philosophy. \n\nThe investigation of complex system has thrived in the last decades, both from an empirical as well as from a conceptual perspective. Many methods emerged or were subsequently adapted to answer questions as well as explore relations, and this thrive towards a deeper understanding of systems is at least one important difference to agency from a methodological standpoint. Much novel data is available, and often inductively explored. The scale of complex systems makes an intervention with a focus on [[Causality and correlation|causality]] a challenge, hence many investigated relations are purely correlative. Take for instance social media, or economic flows, which can be correlatively investigated, yet causality is an altogether different matter. This creates a methodological challenge, since many of our questions regarding human systems are normative, which is why many researchers assume causality in their investigations, or at least discuss relations as if these are causal. Another methodological problem related to causality are non-linear relations, since much of the statistical canon is based on probability and linear relations. While linear relations allow for a better inference of causal explanations, the long existing yet until recently hardly explored [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics are an example that we can inductively learn about systems at a growing pace without being dependent on linearity or normal-distributions. This Bayesian revolution is currently under way, but much of the disciplines relying on statistics did not catch up on this yet. Other methodological approaches will certainly be explored to gain insight into the nuts and bolts of complex systems, yet this is only slowly emerging. \n\nThe whole globe - although not a closed system – can be seen as a global system, and this is certainly worthwhile pursuing from a methodological standpoint. Still, global dynamics consist of such diverse data, that simply the translational act to bring different data together seems almost impossible right now. While emergence can lead to novel solutions, globalisation and technology have triggered uncountable events of emergence, such as global conflicts, climate change, increase in cancer rates and biodiversity loss. Humankind did certainly not plan these potential endpoints of ourselves, instead they emerged out of unpredictable combinations of our actions, and the data that can represent them. From a methodological standpoint, these events are just as unpredictable as is the effect which two molecules have onto each other and the environment. '''Emergence is a truly cross-scalar phenomenon.''' Consequently, many methodological accounts to countermeasure threats to human societies are correlative if they are empirical. We are far away from any deep understanding of emergence, and what makes phenomena emergent.\n[[File:Climate model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Climate models are increasingly getting more accurate, but the complexity and emergence of the global climate system may never be fully understood.'''

4|What is the recommended course of action for datasets with only categorical data?|For datasets containing only categorical data, users are advised to conduct a Chi Square Test. This test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between two categorical variables in the dataset.|"['<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\nlen(data[bool_series])#applying the bool series by checking the null value\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\ndata = data.dropna()\ndata #now, only the rows without the Nas are part of the dataset\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\ndata.shape# you can see here the number of rows (72) and columns (7)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nResult: (72,7)\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\nduplicates= data.duplicated()## checks for duplicates which would distort the results\nprint(duplicates)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThere is  no duplicated data so we can move on analyising the dataset.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\ndata.info()\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHere, you can get an overview over the different datatypes, if there are missing values (""non-null"") and how many entries each column has.

The variables with the ""object"" data format can contain several data formats. However, looking at the three variables, we can see that they are in a categorical data format, having the categories for gender, whether one passed an exam or not, and the category of the different study groups. These categorical variables cannot be used for a regression analysis as the other variables since we cannot analyze an increase in one unit of this variables and its effect on the dependent variable. Instead, we can see how belonging to one of the categories affects the independent variable. For ""sex"" and ""passed"", these are dummy variables. Columns we will treat as dummy variables can take categories in binary format. We can then for example see if and how being female impacts the dependent variable.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\ndata.describe()## here you can an overview over the standard descriptive data.\n</syntaxhighlight> \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\ndata.columns #This command shows you the variables you will be able to use.

Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore.

Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https://www.probabilisticworld.com/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. \'\'\'Nelder\'s and Wedderburn\'s work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.\'\'\' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. \'\'\'Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution\'\'\'. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n\'\'\'Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.\'\'\' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.']"|0.20930232558139536|1.0

Source: own.]]\nCluster analysis shares history in various fields such as anthropology, psychology, biology, medicine, business, computer science, and social science. \n\nIt originated in anthropology when Driver and Kroeber published Quantitative Expression of Cultural Relationships in 1932 where they sought to clusters of [[Glossary|culture]] based on different culture elements. Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as \'\'similarity measure\'\' or \'\'distance measure\'\', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named ""unsupervised learning"", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term ""clustering"" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.\n\n== Data Simulation ==\nThis article deals with simulated data. This section contains the function used to simulate the data. For the purpose of this article, the data has three clusters. You need to load the function on your R environment in order to simulate the data and perform clustering.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" line>\ncreate_cluster_data <- function(n=150, sd=1.5, k=3, random_state=5){\n    # currently, the function only produces 2-d data\n    \n    # n = no. of observation\n    # sd = within-cluster sd\n    # k = number of clusters\n    # random_state = seed\n    \n    set.seed(random_state)\n    dims = 2 # dimensions\n    xs = matrix(rnorm(n*dims, 10, sd=sd), n, dims)\n    clusters = sample(1:k, n, replace=TRUE)\n    centroids = matrix(rnorm(k*dims, mean=1, sd=10), k, dims)\n    clustered_x = cbind(xs + 0.5*centroids[clusters], clusters)\n    \n    plot(clustered_x, col=clustered_x[,3], pch=19)\n    \n    df = as.data.frame(x=clustered_x)\n    colnames(df) <- c(""x1"", ""x2"", ""cluster"")\n    return(df)\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== k-Means Clustering ===\n\nThe k-means clustering method assigns \'\'\'n\'\'\' examples to one of \'\'\'k\'\'\' clusters, where \'\'\'n\'\'\' is the sample size and  \'\'\'k\'\'\', which needs to be chosen before the algorithm is implemented, is the number of clusters. This clustering method falls under a clustering model called centroid model where centroid of a cluster is defined as the mean of all the points in the cluster. K-means Clustering algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimize the within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion based on the following formula:\n\n[[File:K-Means Sum of Squares Criterion.png|center]]\n\nThe in-cluster sum-of-squares is also called inertia in some literature.\n\nThe algorithm involves following steps:\n\n# The number of cluster \'\'\'k\'\'\' is chosen by the data analyst\n# The algorithm randomly picks \'\'\'k\'\'\' centroids and assigns each point to the closest centroid to get \'\'\'k\'\'\' initial clusters\n# The algorithm recalculates the centroid by taking average of all points in each cluster and updates the centroids and re-assigns the points to the closest centroid.\n# The algorithm repeats Step 3 until all points stop changing clusters.\n\nTo get an intuitive sense of how this k-means clustering algorithm works, visit: [https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/ Visualizing K-Means Clustering]\n\n==== Implementing k-Means Clustering in R ====']"|0.015384615384615385|0.0

This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors\' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: ""Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.""

11|What are the strengths and challenges of Content Analysis?|Strengths of Content Analysis include its ability to counteract biases and allow researchers to apply their own social-scientific constructs. Challenges include potential biases in the sampling process, development of the coding scheme, and interpretation of data, as well as the inability to generalize theories and hypotheses beyond the data in qualitative analysis of smaller samples.|"['== Strengths & Challenges ==\n==== Strengths ====\n* Focus Groups allow to explore people’s views in a social context: “We learn about the \'meaning\' of AIDS, (or sex, or health or food or cigarettes) through talking with and observing other people, through conversations at home or at work; and we act (or fail to act) on that knowledge in a social context. When researchers want to explore people\'s understandings, or to influence them, it makes sense to employ methods which actively encourage the examination of these social processes in action.” (Kitzinger, p. 117). As Säynäjoki et al. (2014, p.6625) highlight: ""Focus groups are particularly useful in studies where the researcher seeks to uncover attitudes, perceptions and beliefs.""\n* Furthermore, the group atmosphere makes many participants feel more at ease and encourages them to share their thoughts and perceptions.\n* Finally, Focus Groups are a way to gather data from several people at a time and are thus considered to be cost-effective and timesaving (4).\n\n==== Challenges ====\n* A challenge one needs to be aware of when conducting and analyzing Focus Groups is the censorship of certain – e.g. minority or marginalized – viewpoints, which can arise from the group composition (3). As Parker and Tritter (2006, p. 31) note: “At the collective level, what often emerges from a focus group discussion is a number of positions or views that capture the majority of the participants’ standpoints. Focus group discussions rarely generate consensus but they do tend to create a number of views which different proportions of the group support.""\n* Further, considering the effect group dynamics have on the viewpoints expressed by the participants is important, as the same people might answer differently in an individual interview. Depending on the focus of the study, either a Focus Group, an individual interview or a combination of both might be appropriate (3).\n* Last but not least - and as with other qualitative research methods - Focus Groups do not necessarily aim for representativeness but for an in-depth understanding of the perspectives studied (3). However, “as the number of focus groups in the overall sample increases and their composition broadens, there is an extent to which the representativeness of their findings might be viewed as more acceptable and valid.” (Parker, pp. 30).\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nWith regards to future research, Bloor et al. (2001) see the necessity to employ more resources and effort regarding “group composition, recruitment, planning, conduct, transcription and analysis” (p. 89) for Focus Groups to fulfill the requirements on methods used in the field of academic social research (in comparison to pure market research for example).\n\nAdditionally, future publications of studies which applied Focus Groups should place more focus on the impact the recruitment and the sampling process had on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. Thus, more information on how Focus Group participants were sampled or on which basis a certain sample size (i.e. number of groups) was chosen should be provided, and their implications on the interaction among the participants as well as the data analysis and interpretation should be discussed (5, 2).\n\nGiven the complexity of Focus Group data, also the development of further methodologies for data analysis should be continued (5, 4).\n\n\n== An exemplary study ==\n[[File:Focus Groups exemplary study Säynäjoki et al. 2014 - Title.png|600px|frameless|center|The title of the exemplary Focus Group study (Säynäjoki et al. 2014).]]\n\'\'\'Säynäjoki et al (2014) used Focus Groups to investigate how Finnish urban planners perceive the potential positive impact of their field on environmental sustainability.\'\'\' Focus Groups were chosen since ""the focus of the study was not solely on what people think but on how they articulate, rationalise, challenge each other\'s views"" (p.6625). The researchers invited 32 urban planning specialists to a workshop, including individuals ""from fourteen Finnish cities, the Finnish environment ministry, two architectural firms, four consulting companies, one of Finland’s largest energy companies, a market leading construction company, the Green Building Council Finland and the Finnish Association of Building Owners and Construction Clients (RAKLI)"" (p.6626). \n\n\'\'\'The researchers asked this group three questions as a prompt to the subsequent focus group sessions:\'\'\'\n* ""Why is environmental sustainability assessed in urban planning?""\n* ""How does environmental assessment steer decision-making in urban planning?""\n* ""What is the role of urban planning in environmental sustainability?""\n\n\'\'\'Then, the 32 participants were divided into three groups of 11, 11 and 10 participants, respectively, with one moderating researcher each.\'\'\' All moderators were provided with the same guideline, and their role was ""to enhance interaction and to ensure that all participants had an equal chance to contribute."" However, ""[w]ithin these limits, much of the discussion was left to the participants in order to learn what they found interesting and important. Nevertheless, occasionally the moderators attempted to develop the discourses by encouraging the participants to explain their views, or even through discreet provocation. The group discussions, each approximately an hour in length, were audio-recorded and manually transcribed and also video-recorded. In parallel with the recordings, the moderators made notes concerning mainly the atmosphere, the interaction and the participants’ reactions."" (p.6627). Importantly, in addition to the three questions that were posed prior to the focus groups, two further questions guided the moderators\' actions:\n* ""How is the power of urban planners to promote environmental sustainability limited?""\n* ""How is urban density considered in terms of environmentally sustainable land use?""']"|0.10810810810810811|0.5

This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson\'s correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks.

The t-statistic is a random variable which is distributed according to the t-distribution, from which rejection intervals can be constructed, to be used for hypothesis testing.\n[[File:prbdst3.png|450px|thumb|center|Fig.1: The probability density function of the t-distribution for 9 degrees of freedom.

If the two samples are independent from each other, an independent two-sample t-test has to be used.

These variables were chosen to ""fall within the field of expertise of the respondents, and at the same time be as independent of each other as possible."" (p.316). The participants were provided with information on the past developments of each of these variables.\n\nThe researchers decided to go with three rounds until consensus should be reached. For the first round, questionnaires were distributed by mail, and the participants had one week to answer them. The second and third round were held on the same day after this one-week period. \'\'\'The responses from the respective previous round were re-distributed to the participants\'\'\' (each individual answer including additional comments, as well as the group average and the median for each variable).

Based on the post-Delphi survey answers, and the results for the 15 variables, the researchers further inferred that ""paying attention to each others\' answers made the forecasts more accurate"" (p.320), and that the participants were well able to assess the accuracy of their own estimates. The researchers calculated many more measures and a comparison to a non-Delphi forecasting round, which you can read more about in the publication.

18|What is the main goal of Sustainability Science and what are the challenges it faces?|The main goal of Sustainability Science is to develop practical and contexts-sensitive solutions to existent problems through cooperative research with societal actors. The challenges it faces include the need for more work to solve problems and create solutions, the importance of how solutions and knowledge are created, the necessity for society and science to work together, and the challenge of building an educational system that is reflexive and interconnected.|"['\'\'\'Transdisciplinary research is of special importance to Sustainability Science and has received immense recognition in this field in the last years.\'\'\' This is because ""[s]ustainability is also inherently transdisciplinary"" (Stock & Burton 2011, p.1091), as it builds on the premise of solving real-world problems which are deeply nestled in ecological, political, economic and social processes and structures and therefore cannot be understood and solved without engaging with these spheres (Kates et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary research is a suitable approach for Sustainability Science: it allows to incorporate the knowledge of relevant stakeholders; it considers the normative dimensions involved in societal endeavors (that is, diverging norms, goals and visions of different societal spheres); and it increases [[Glossary|legitimacy]], ownership and accountability for the jointly developed solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Stock & Burton 2011). The integrative transdisciplinary approach highlights systemic interdependencies, enables a better understanding of complex issues and provides better knowledge to develop socially robust and applicable, effective solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2015).\n\n\n== How to do TD in Sustainability Science ==\nHere, we will refer to the ideal-typical model presented by Lang et al (2012). It introduces a conceptual guide, structured into three phases, on how transdisciplinary research for sustainability science should ideally be conducted. The relevant steps of each phase as well as general principles for the whole process will be listed below. The presented process is recursive: Problems emerging in scientific as well as societal practice are integrated in the transdisciplinary research approach. After its three phases have been realized, the newly generated knowledge and solutions are re-integrated into these two spheres, where they are applied and consolidated. Ultimately, new challenges emerge that demand renewed transdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n==== The ideal-typical model ====\n[[File:TDmodel.png|500px|thumb|left|\'\'\'The ideal-typical model for TD research in Sustainability Science.\'\'\' Source: Lang et al. 2012]]\n\n\'\'Phase A\'\'\n* Build a collaborative research team.\n* Create joint understandings and definitions of the problem.\n* Collaboratively define research objects and objectives, research questions, and success criteria.\n* Design a methodological [[Glossary|framework]].\n\n\'\'Phase B\'\'\n* Assign roles and responsibilities.\n* Apply research methods and settings to create the intended knowledge.\n\n\'\'Phase C\'\'\n* Realize two-dimensional integration.\n* Generate products for both parties (societal and scientific).\n\n\'\'General principles\'\'\n* Facilitate continuous evaluation\n* Mitigate conflict constellations\n* Enhance capabilities for and interest in participation\n<br>\n\n==== Challenges ====\nThere is a wide range of potential pitfalls challenging the achieval of the ideal-typical model.\n\n* Mauser et al.

Further, they comment that integrated research modes demand new methods and concepts, new institutional arrangements, organizational [[Glossary|competencies]] and tailored funding possibilities. The cooperation between science and society requires reflexive learning processes, appropriate communication tools and also needs to reflect on the role of science in the overall endeavour. Also, the authors highlight that there may be inertia to change in the given system which needs to be overcome.\n* Lang et al. (2012) name various issues in the framing of problems (lack of problem awareness, unbalanced problem ownership), processual issues (insufficient legitimacy of the actors involved, conflicting methodological standards, lack of integration (knowledge, structures, [[Glossary|communication)]], discontinuous [[Glossary|participation]]), as well as challenges concerning the development of solutions (ambiguity of results, fear to fail, limited solution options, lack of legitimacy of transdisciplinary outcomes, capitalization on distorted research results, issues when tracking impacts). Also, ""[a]rguing from a more conventional research perspective, scientists might be skeptical with respect to reliability, validity, and other epistemological and methodological aspects of collaborative research (‘‘credibility’’). Practitioners and stakeholders, on the other hand, might be skeptical regarding the practical relevance of the results (‘‘salience’’)."" (Lang et al. 2012)\n* Hall & Rourke (2014) expand on communicative challenges, claiming that ""[n]ot all of the challenges that threaten TDSS [transdisciplinary sustainability science] are communication challenges, but communication breakdown can exacerbate any of them. Because of its centrality, care must be taken by collaborators to cultivate a healthy communication dynamic; however, given the many perspectives involved in a typical TDSS project, this will not be easy. These projects meet complex problems with complex responses, entailing the need to remain flexible and responsive to participant requirements and the need to modify the approach if new information and values arise."" They highlight communicative challenges especially in the framing of problems (exclusion of important perspectives, different views of the problem) and the conduction of the research (unwillingness to share personal perspectives, failure to recognize or articulate differences in individual assumptions, uncertainties and incomplete or incompatible knowledge, limited cognitive abilities to integrated individual partial knowledge).\n\n==== Methods of transdisciplinary research ====\nSeveral scientific methods are useful for transdisciplinary work.

19|Why are critical theory and ethics important in modern science?|Critical theory and ethics are important in modern science because it is flawed with a singular worldview, built on oppression and inequalities, and often lacks the necessary link between empirical and ethical consequences.|"[""The disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https://www.thoughtco.com/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.""]"|0.2|1.0
20|What is system thinking?|System thinking is a method of investigation that considers interactions and interdependencies within a system, which could be anything from a business to a population of wasps.|"['== What the method does ==\nBefore explaining System Thinking, it should first be explained what is a \'system\'.\n\n==== Systems, System Thinking, System Analysis & System Dynamics ====\nA system is a ""(...) network of multiple variables that are connected to each other through causal relationships"", based on which the network ""(...) expresses some sort of behaviour, which can only be characterized through observation as a whole"" (Haraldsson 2004, p.11). This behavior remains persistent in a variety of circumstances. More simply put, a system is a ""(...) collection of connected things (...) that influence one another."" (Toole 2005, p.2) Both the collection of elements and their interactions are important elements of the system which is emphasized by saying that a system is \'more than a collection of its parts\' (Arnold & Wade 2015, p.2).\n\nEvery system is ""(...) defined by its boundaries"" (Haraldsson 2004, p.13). The borders we draw for our system analysis influence which level of detail we apply to our view on the system, and which elements we investigate. System elements can be animate (animals, humans) or inanimate (rocks, rain), conceptual (motivation) or real (harvest), quantifiable (money) or rather qualitative (well-being) (2). For example, a system could be a tree, with the leaves, the stem and such elements interacting with each other, but also the forest in which our tree interacts with the soil, the weather, other plants, animals and inanimate objects. The system could also be the globe, where this forest interacts with other ecosystems, or the system in which Planet Earth interacts with the rest of the universe - our solar system. For more background on the definition of System Boundaries, please refer to [[System Boundaries|this entry.]]\n\n\'\'\'The system is at the basis of System Thinking.\'\'\' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding \'systems\' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of \'holistic\' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that ""(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear"" and that ""(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions"" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n\'\'\'Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:\'\'\' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a \'system\' in this sense.\n\nSoft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a \'system\' an ""(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world"" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a \'system\'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|\'\'\'Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking\'\'\' according to Checkland. Source: Checkland 2000, p.18]]\n\nSystem Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: \'\'System Analysis\'\' and \'\'System Dynamics\'\' (1).\n\n\'\'System Analysis\'\' ""(...) is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships."" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). \'\'System Analysis\'\', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below. For more information, refer to the entry on [[System Analysis]].\n\n\'\'System Dynamics\'\', then, focuses on the interaction part of the system. It ""(...) refers to the re-creation of the understanding of a system and its feedbacks. It aims at exploring dynamic responses to changes within or from outside the system. (...) System Dynamics deals with mathematical representation of our mental models and is a secondary step after we have developed our mental model."" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). System Dynamics, as the name suggests, enables the researcher to observe and measure the behavior of the system. The interactions between the individual elements are not just recreated, but the consequences of these interactions are quantified and assessed.']"|0.2894736842105263|0.0
21|What is the main principle of the Feynman Method?|The main principle of the Feynman Method is that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it.|"['{|class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align: center; width: 100%""\n! colspan = ""4"" | Type !! colspan = ""4"" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || \'\'\'[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]\'\'\' || \'\'\'[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]\'\'\' || \'\'\'[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]\'\'\' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n\'\'Teaching is the best way to learn.\'\'\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# \'\'\'Select the topic you want to learn more about.\'\'\' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don\'t go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain ""Economics"" or ""Physics"" in one go.\n# \'\'\'Find someone to talk to\'\'\'. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don\'t have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# \'\'\'Make notes.\'\'\' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# \'\'\'Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.\'\'\' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# \'\'\'Now explain the topic again.\'\'\' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it.

22|What is the difference between fixed and random factors in ANOVA designs?|Fixed effects are the focus of the study, while random effects are aspects we want to ignore. In medical trials, whether someone smokes is usually a random factor, unless the study is specifically about smoking. Factors in a block design are typically random, while variables related to our hypothesis are fixed.|"[""When designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results. Subsequently, ANOVA experiments became more complex, combining several independent variables and also allowing to correct for so called random factors, which are elements for which the variance is calculated out of the ANOVA model. This allows for instance to increase the sample size to minimise the effects of the variance in an agricultural experiment which is being conducted on several agricultural fields. In this example, agricultural fields are then included as block factor, which allows to minimise the variance inferred by these replications. Hence, the variance of the agricultural fields is tamed by a higher number of replicates. This led to the ANOVA becoming one of the most relevant methods in statistics, yet recent developments such as the reproducibility crisis in psychology highlight that care needs to be taken to not overplay ones hand. Preregistering hypotheses and more recognition of the [[Limitations of Statistics|limitations]] of such designs currently pave a path towards a more critical future of statistical designs. \n\nAnother development that emerged during the last decades is the conducting of so called real-world experiments, which are often singular case studies with interventions, yet typically less or no control of variables. These approaches are slowly being developed in diverse branches of research, and allow to open a [[Meta-Analysis|meta-analytical]] dimension, where a high number of case studies is averaged in terms of the research results. The combination of different studies enables a different perspective, yet currently such approaches are either restricted to rigid clinical trials or to meta-analyses with more variables than cases. \n\nReal-world experiments are thus slowly emerging to bridge experimental rigour with the often perceived messiness of the problems we face and how we engage with them as researchers, knowing that one key answer involving these is the joint learning together with stakeholders. This development may allow us to move one step further in current [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|systems thinking]], where still many phenomena we cannot explained are simply labeled as complex. We will have to acknowledge in the future which phenomena we may begin to understand in the future, and which phenomena we may never be able to fully understand. [[Non-equilibrium dynamics|Non-equilibrium theory]] is an example where unpredictable dynamics can still be approaches by a scientific theory. Chaos theory is another example, where it is clear that we may not be able to grasp the dynamics we investigate in a statistical sense, yet we may be able to label dynamics as chaotic and allow a better understanding of our own limitations. Complexity is somewhat inbetween, leaning partly towards the explainable, yet also having stakes in the unexplainable dynamics we face. '''Statistics is thus at a crossroad, since we face the limitations of our approaches, and have to become better in taking these into account.''' \n\nWithin statistics, new approches are rapidly emerging, yet to date the dominion of scientific disciplines still haunts our ability to apply the most parsimonious model. Instead, the norms of our respective discipline still override our ability to acknowledge not only our limitations, but also the diverse biases we face as statisticians, scientists and as a people. Civil society is often still puzzled how to make sense of our contributions that originate in statistics, and we have to become better in contextualising statistical results, and translate the consequences of these to other people. '''To date, there is a huge gap between [[Ethics and Statistics|statistics and ethics,]] and the 20th century has proven that a perspective restricted to numbers will not suffice, but instead may contribute to our demise.''' We need to find ways to not only create statistical results, but also face the responsibility of the consequences of such analyses and interpretations. In the future, more people may be able to approximate knowlegde though statistics, and to be equally able to act based on this knowledge in a reasonable sense, bridging societal demands with our capacity for change. \n\n\n==What was missing==\nEverybody who actively participated in this module now has a glimpse of what statistics is all about. I like to joke that if statistics is like the iceberg that sank the Titanic, then you now have enough ice for a Gin-Tonic, and you should enjoy that. The colleagues I admire for their skills in terms of statistics spent several thousand hours of their life on statistics, some even tens of thousands of hours. By comparison, this module encapsulates about 150 hours, at least according to the overall plan. Therefore, this module focuses on knowledge. It does not include the advanced statistics that demand experience. Questions of models reductions, [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]], [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis#Multivariate_statistics|multivariate statistics]] and many other approaches were never touched upon, because this would have been simply too much.""]"|0.0|1.0
23|What is the replication crisis and how does it affect modern research?|The replication crisis refers to the inability to reproduce a substantial proportion of modern research, affecting fields like psychology, medicine, and economics. This is due to statistical issues such as the arbitrary significance threshold of p=0.05, flaws in the connection between theory and methodological design, and the increasing complexity of statistical models.|"[""==Replication of experiments==\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 17.10.27.png|thumb|One famous example from the discipline of psychology is the Milgram shock experiment carried out by Stanley Milgram a professor from the Yale University in 1963.]]\nField experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https://revisesociology.com/2016/01/17/field-experiments-sociology/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments. Consider Occam’s razor also when designing a study.\n\n==External Links==\n===Articles===\n\n[https://explorable.com/field-experiments Field Experiments]: A definition\n\n[https://www.tutor2u.net/psychology/reference/field-experiments Field Experiments]: Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_experiment#Examples Examples of Field Experiments]: A look into different disciplines\n\n[https://conjointly.com/kb/experimental-design/ Experimental Design]: Why it is important\n\n[https://isps.yale.edu/node/16697 Randomisation]: A detailed explanation\n\n[https://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Bulletins/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch/Text-Version/Basics-of-Experimental-Design Experimental Design in Agricultural Experiments]: Some basics\n\n[https://www.ndsu.edu/faculty/horsley/RCBD.pdf Block Design]: An introduction with some example calculations\n\n[https://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/Bulletins/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch/Text-Version/Basics-of-Experimental-Design/Common-Research-Designs-for-Farmers Block designs in Agricultural Experiments]:Common Research Designs for Farmers\n\n[https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/the-difference-between-crossed-and-nested-factors/ Difference between crossed & nested factors]: A short article\n\n[https://www.ohio.edu/plantbio/staff/mccarthy/quantmet/lectures/ANOVA-III.pdf Nested Designs]: A detailed presentation\n\n[https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/regression/supporting-topics/regression-models/model-reduction/ Model reduction]: A helpful article\n\n[https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/fixedvsrandom.html Random vs. Fixed Factors]: A differentiation\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 Field Experiments in Agriculture]: Ronald Fisher's experiment\n\n[https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html Field Experiments in Psychology]: A famous example\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0372-0 Field Experiments in Economics]: An example paper\n\n[https://revisesociology.com/2016/01/17/field-experiments-sociology/ Field Experiments in Sociology]: Some examples\n\n===Videos===\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10ikXret7Lk Types of Experimental Designs]: An introduction""]"|0.3023255813953488|1.0

Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. \'\'\'Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution\'\'\'. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n\'\'\'Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.\'\'\' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.']"|0.11627906976744186|1.0
26|What is a heatmap and why is it useful?|A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where numerical values are replaced with colors. It is useful for understanding data as it allows for easy comparison of values and their distribution.|"['\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' This entry revolves specifically around Heatmaps. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n\'\'\'In short:\'\'\' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>heatmap()</syntaxhighlight> function and \'\'\'mtcars\'\'\' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>heatmap()</syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting. Therefore we need to check if our dataset only includes numbers and then transform our dataset into a matrix, using <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>as.matrix()</syntaxhighlight> function.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" line>\ndata(""mtcars"")\nmatcars <- as.matrix(mtcars)\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAlso, for better representation, we are going to rename the columns, giving them their full names. It is not a mandatory step, but it makes our heatmap more comprehensible.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" line>\nfullcolnames <- c(""Miles per Gallon"", ""Number of Cylinders"",\n                  ""Displacement"", ""Horsepower"", ""Rear Axle Ratio"",\n                  ""Weight"", ""1/4 Mile Time"", ""Engine"", ""Transmission"",\n                  ""Number of Gears"", ""Number of Carburetors"")\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we are using the transformed dataset (matcars) to create the heatmap. Other used arguments are explained below.\n[[File:Heatmap.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" line>\n#Fig.1\nheatmap(matcars, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, \n        scale = ""column"", labCol = fullcolnames, \n        margins = c(11,5))\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== How to interpret a heatmap? ==\n\nIn the default color palette the interpretation is usually the following: the darker the color the higher the responding value, and vice versa. For example, let’s look at the feature <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>“Number of Carburetors”</syntaxhighlight>. We can see that \'\'\'Maserati Bora\'\'\' has the darkest color, hence it has the largest number of carburetors, followed by \'\'\'Ferrari Dino\'\'\', which has the second-largest number of carburetors. While other models such as \'\'\'Fiat X1-9\'\'\' or \'\'\'Toyota\'\'\' have the lightest colors. It means that they have the lowest numbers of carburetors. This interpretation can be applied to every other column.']"|0.018867924528301886|1.0
27|How did Alhazen contribute to the development of scientific methods?|Alhazen contributed to the development of scientific methods by being the first to systematically manipulate experimental conditions, paving the way for the scientific method.|"[""Many concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a. Ibn al-Haytham]. Emerging from the mathematics of antiquity and combining this with the generally rising investigation of physics, Alhazen was the first to manipulate [[Field_experiments|experimental conditions]] in a systematic sense, thereby paving the way towards the scientific method, which would emerge centuries later. Alhazen is also relevant because he could be considered a polymath, highlighting the rise of more knowledge that actually enabled such characters, but still being too far away from the true formation of the diverse canon of [[Design Criteria of Methods|scientific disciplines]], which would probably have welcomed him as an expert on one matter or the other. Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on '''the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.'''\n\n==== Before Enlightenment - ''Measure And Solve'' ====\n[[File:Normal_Mercator_map_85deg.jpg|thumb|300px|left|'''Mercator world map.'''

While many European maps were detailed but surely not on scale (Ebstorfer Weltkarte), early maps still enabled a supra-regional trade. The real breakthrough was the [[Geographical Information Systems|Mercator map]], which was - restricted to the knowledge at the time - the first map that enabled a clear navigation across the oceans, enabling colonialism and Western dominions and domination of the world. This is insofar highly relevant for methods, because it can be argued that the surplus from the colonies and distant countries was one of the main drivers of the thriving of the European colonial rulers, their economies and consequently, their science. A direct link can be made between the [[Normativity of Methods|inequalities]] that were increased by colonialism and the thriving of Western science, including the development of scientific methods.\n\n[[File:printing-press-2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|'''Invention of the printing press'''.

A link can be made to translations and interpretations of the Bible, and many other religious discourses are indeed not different from deep text analysis and the derivation of interpretations. Hermeneutics go clearly a step further, and hence are one of the earliest and to date still most important scientific methods. [[Thought Experiments]] were another line of thinking that started to emerge more rapidly. By focussing on ''What if'' questions, scientists considered all sorts of questions to derive patterns of even law of nature ([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/galileo/ Galileo]) and also directed their view into the future. Thought experiments were in an informal way known since antiquity, yet during medieval times these assumptions became a trigger to question much of what was supposedly known. Through experiments they became early staring points for subsequent more systematic experimentation. \n\n[[File:Somer_Francis_Bacon.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Francis Bacon.''' Source: [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon Wikipedia]]] \nIt was [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/ Francis Bacon] who ultimately moved out of this dominance of thinking and called for the importance of empirical inquiry. '''By observing nature and its phenomena, we are able to derive conclusion based on the particular.''' Bacon is thus often coined to be the father of 'the scientific method', an altogether misleading term, as there are many scientific methods. However, empiricism, meaning the empirical investigation of phenomena and the derivation of results or even rules triggered a scientific revolution, and also a specialization of different scientific branches. While Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had been a polymath less than a century ago, Bacon (1561-1626) triggered an increase in empirical inquiry that led to the deeper formation of scientific disciplines. Many others contributed to this development: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/ Locke] claimed that human knowledge builds on experience, and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ Hume] propelled this into skepticism, casting the spell of doubt on anything that is rooted in belief or dogma. By questioning long standing knowledge, science kicked in - among other things - the door of god himself, a circumstance that is too large to be presented here in any sense. What is important however is that - starting from the previous age of diverse approaches to knowledge - the combination of empiricism on the one end, and the associated philosophical developments on the other end, the age of reason had dawned.\n\n[[File:Timeline of methods V2.jpg|600px|frame|center|'''A timeline of major breakthroughs in science.'''

28|How can multivariate data be graphically represented?|Multivariate data can be graphically represented through ordination plots, cluster diagrams, and network plots. Ordination plots can include various approaches like decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from non-metric dimensional scaling. Cluster diagrams show the grouping of data and are useful for displaying hierarchical structures. Network plots illustrate interactions between different parts of the data.|"[""'''In short:''' This entry introduces you to the most relevant forms of [[Glossary|data]] visualisation, and links to dedicated entries on specific visualisation forms with R examples.\n\n== Basic forms of data visualisation ==\n__TOC__\nThe easiest way to represent count information are basically '''barplots'''. They are a bit over simplistic if they contain only one level of information such as three groups and their abundance, and can be more advanced if they contain two levels of information such as in stacked barplots. These can be shown as either absolute numbers or proportions, which may make a dramatic difference for the analysis or interpretation.\n\n'''Correlation plots''' ('xyplots') are the next staple in statistical graphics and most often the graphical representation of a correlation. Further, often also a regression is implemented to show effect strengths and variance. Fitting a [[Regression Analysis|regression]] line is often the most important visual aid to showcase the trend. Through point size or color can another information level be added, making this a really powerful tool, where one needs to keep a keen eye on the relation between correlation and causality. Such plots may also serve to show fluctuations in data over time, showing trends within data as well as harmonic patterns.\n\n'''Boxplots''' are the last in what I would call the trinity of statistical figures. Showing the variance of continuous data across different factor levels is what these plots are made of. While histograms reveal more details and information, boxplots are a solid graphical representation of the Analysis of Variance. A rule of thumb is that if one box is higher or lower than the median (the black line) of the other box, the difference may be signifiant.\n\n[[File:Xyplot.png|250px|thumb|left|'''A Correlation plot.'''

They can help reveal a lot of useful information about numerical data with a single explanatory variable. Histograms are used for getting a sense about the distribution of data, its median, and skewness.\n\nSimple '''pie charts''' are not really ideal, as they camouflage the real proportions of the data they show. '''Venn diagrams''' are a simple way to compare 2-4 groups and their overlaps, allowing for multiple hits. Larger co-connections can either be represented by a '''bipartite plot''', if the levels are within two groups, or, if multiple interconnections exist, then a '''structural equation model''' representation is valuable for more deductive approaches, while rather inductive approaches can be shown by '''circular network plots''' (aka [[Chord Diagram]]).\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Venn Diagram example.png|200px|thumb|left|'''A Venn Diagram showing the number of articles in a systematic review that revolve around one or more of three topics.'''

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

32|What is the main goal of practicing mindfulness?|The main goal of practicing mindfulness is to clear the mind and focus on the present moment, free from normative assumptions.|"['{|class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align: center; width: 100%""\n! colspan = ""4"" | Type !! colspan = ""4"" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || \'\'\'[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]\'\'\' || [[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]] || \'\'\'[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]\'\'\' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n[[File:Noble Eightfold Path - Mindfulness.png|350px|thumb|right|\'\'\'The Noble Eightfold Path, with Mindfulness being the seventh practice.\'\'\' Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path Wikipedia], Ian Alexander, CC BY-SA 4.0]]\nMindfulness is a [[Glossary|concept]] with diverse facets. In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative [[Glossary|assumptions]] that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the context of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.\n\n== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having ""no mind"", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen – sitting meditation – is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|\'\'\'[https://www.headspace.com/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate\'\'\', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you. Source: Headspace]]\n\nDuring the last decades mindfulness took a strong tooting in the western world, and the commercialisation of the principle of mindfulness led to the development of several approaches and even apps, like Headspace, that can introduce lay people to a regular practice. The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around – often referred to as the monkey mind –, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/02/28/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions – just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

The information should focus on key terms and data, omitting unnecessary details. Elements can be connected to the central topic through lines or branches, creating a web structure. Colors, symbols, and images can be used to further structure the map, and the thickness of the connections can vary to indicate importance.|"['{|class=""wikitable"" style=""text-align: center; width: 100%""\n! colspan = ""4"" | Type !! colspan = ""4"" | Team Size\n|-\n| \'\'\'[[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]]\'\'\' || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || [[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]] || \'\'\'[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]\'\'\' || \'\'\'[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]\'\'\' || \'\'\'[[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]]\'\'\' || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\'\'\'Mindmapping is a tool for the visual organisation of information\'\'\', showing ideas, words, names and more in relation to a central topic and to each other. The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|\'\'\'MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters/bubbles, as in this example.\'\'\' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols.

It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings.

Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher\'s introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher\'s experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: \'\'\'Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and/or continuous]] independent variables\'\'\'. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. \'\'\'The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.\'\'\' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.\n\nOften, these models serve as a baseline for the whole scheme of analysis, and thus already help researchers to design and plan their whole data campaign. Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n\'\'\'The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.\'\'\' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done \'\'better\'\' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know.']"|0.047619047619047616|0.0
35|How do Mixed Effect Models compare to Analysis of Variance and Regressions in terms of statistical power and handling complex datasets?|Mixed Effect Models surpass Analysis of Variance in terms of statistical power and eclipse Regressions by being better able to handle the complexities of real world datasets.|"[""There has been some sort of a revival of r<sup>2</sup> values lately, mainly based on the suggestion of r<sup>2</sup> values that can be utilised for Mixed Effect Models. I deeply reject these approaches. First of all, Mixed Effect Models are not about how much the model explains, but whether the results are meaningfully different from the null model. I can understand that in a cancer study I would want to know how much my model may help people, hence an occasional glance of the fitted value against the original values may do no harm. However, r<sup>2</sup> in Mixed Effect Models is - to me - a step into the bad old days when we evaluated the worth of a model because of its ability to explain variance. This led to a lot of feeble discussions, of which I only mention here the debate on how good a model needs to be in terms of these values to be not bad, and vice versa. This is obviously a problem, and such normative judgements are a reason why statistics have such a bad reputation. Second, people are starting again to actually report their models based on the r<sup>2</sup>  value, and even have their model selection not independent of the r<sup>2</sup> value. This is something that should be bygone, yet it is not. '''Beware of the r<sup>2</sup> value, it is only deceiving you in Mixed Effect Models.''' Third, r<sup>2</sup> values in Mixed Effect Models are deeply problematic because they cannot take the complexity of the random variance into account. Hence, r<sup>2</sup> values in Mixed Effect Models make us go back to the other good old days, when mean values were ruling the outcomes of science. Today, we are closer to an understanding where variance matters, and why would we embrace that. Ok, it comes with a longer learning curve, but I think that the good old reduction to the mean was nothing but mean.\n\nAnother very important point regarding Mixed Effect Models is that they - probably more than any statistical method - remark the point where experts in one method (say for example interviews) now needed to learn how to conduct interviews as a scientific method, but also needed to learn advanced statistics in the form of Mixed Effect Models. This creates a double burden, and while learning several methods can be good to embrace a more diverse understanding, it is also challenging, and highlights a new development. Today, statistical analysis are increasingly outsourced to experts, and I consider this to be a generally good development. In my own experience, it takes a few thousand hours to become versatile at Mixed Effect Models, and modern science is increasingly built on collaboration.\n\n== Outlook ==\nIn terms of Mixed Effect Models, language barriers and the norms of specific disciplines are rather strong. Explaining the basics of these advanced statistics to colleagues is an art in itself, just as the experience of researchers being versatile in [[Semi-structured Interview|Interview]]s cannot be reduced into a few hours of learning. Education in science needs to tackle this head on, and stop teaching statistics that are outdated and hardly published. I suggest that at least on a Master's level, in the long run, all students from the quantitative domain should be able to understand the preconditions and benefits of Mixed Effect Models, but this is something for the distant future. Today, PhD students being versatile in Mixed Effect Models are still outliers. Let us all hope that this statement will be outdated rather sooner than later. Mixed Effect Models are surely powerful and quite adaptable, and are increasingly becoming a part of normal science. Honouring the complexity of the world while still deriving value statements based on statistical analyses has never been more advanced on a broader scale. '''Still, statisticians need to recognize the limitations of real world data, and researchers utilising these need to honour the preconditions and pitfalls of these analyses'''. Current science is in my perception far away from reporting reproducible analyses, meaning that one and the same dataset will be differently analysed by Mixed Effect Model approaches, partly based on experience, partly based on differences between disciplines, and probably also because of many other factors. Mixed Effect Models need to be consolidated and unified, which would make normale science probably better than ever.\n\n== Key Publications ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Inductive]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.""]"|0.13333333333333333|0.0
36|Why should stepwise procedures in model reduction be avoided?|Stepwise procedures in model reduction should be avoided because they are not smart but brute force approaches based on statistical evaluations, and they do not include any experience or preconceived knowledge. They are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way.|"['== \'\'\'Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach\'\'\' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam\'s razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam\'s razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word ""fairly"" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented.']"|0.043478260869565216|0.0
37|What are the methods to identify redundancies in data for model reduction?|The methods to identify redundancies in data for model reduction are through correlations, specifically Pearson correlation, and ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables.|['The last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis. \n\nWithin inductive analysis it is less clear how to proceed best. Technically, one can only proceed based on AIC values. Again, there is a brute force approach that boils the maximum model down based on permutations of all combinations. However, this approach can be again considered to be statistical fishing, since no clear hypothesis are tested. While an AIC driven approach failsafes against the worst dangers of statistical fishing, it is clear that if you have no questions, then you also have no answers. Hence a purely inductive analysis does not really make sense, yet you can find the inner relations and main patterns of the dataset regardless of your approach, may it bee inductive or deductive. \n\nDeep down, any given dataset should reveal the same results based on this rigid analysis pathway and framework. However, the scientific community developed different approaches, and there are diverse schools of thinking, which ultimately leads to different approaches being out there. Different analysts may come up with different results. This exemplifies that statistics are not fully unleashed yet, but are indeed still evolving, and not necessarily about reproducible analysis. Keep that in mind when you read analysis, and be conservative in your own analysis. Keep no stone unturned, and go down any rabbit hole you can find.']|0.0|0.0

The term \'narrative\' includes both: the story itself, with its dramaturgy, characters and plot, as well as the act of storytelling (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). However, the term \'narrative\' has been used used predominantly as a synonym for \'story\' in academia for decades (Barrett & Stauffer 2009).\n\n\'\'\'Psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the notion of \'narrative\' as being one of two forms of distinct modes of thinking in 1984\'\'\' - the other being the \'logico-scientific\' mode (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). While the latter is ""(...) more concerned with establishing universal truth conditions"" (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.9), the \'narrative\' mode represents the broad human experience of reality. This distinction led to further investigation on the idea that \'narratives\' are a central form of human learning about - and [[Glossary|sense-making]] of - the world. Scholars began to recognize the role of analyzing narratives in order to understand individual and societal experiences and the meanings that are attached to these. This led e.g. to the establishment of the field of narrative psychology.\n\n\'\'\'As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased \'narrative\' - is a rather recent phenomenon\'\'\' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of \'narrative\' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n\'\'\'First, there is a distinction to be made:\'\'\' \'Narrative\' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. \'Narrative\' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n\'\'\'Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches\'\'\', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.']"|0.08108108108108109|1.0

Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https://www.probabilisticworld.com/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. \'\'\'Nelder\'s and Wedderburn\'s work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.\'\'\' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. \'\'\'Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution\'\'\'. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n\'\'\'Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.\'\'\' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.']"|0.18604651162790697|0.0
40|What are the three conditions under which Poisson Distribution can be used?|Poisson Distribution can be used when 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.|"['THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE\n==1. Introduction to Probability Distribution==\nA probability distribution summarizes the probabilities for the values of a random variable. The general properties/features that define a distribution include the four mathematical moments: \n\n1.\t\'\'\'Expected value E(X)\'\'\': This is the outcome with the highest probability or likelihood or an average or mean value for the variable X.\n \n2.\t\'\'\'Variance Var(X)\'\'\': Variance denotes the spread of the values from the expected value. The standard deviation is the normalized value of variance obtained by taking a square root of the variance. The covariance summarizes the linear relationship for how the two variables change with respect to each other. \n\n3.\t\'\'\'Skewness\'\'\': Skewness is the measure of asymmetry of a random variable X about the mean E(X) of a probability distribution. It can be positive (tail on the right side), negative (tail on left side), zero (balanced tail on both sides) or undefined. Zero skewness does not always mean symmetric distribution as one tail can be long and thin and the other can be short and fat. \na\n4.\t\'\'\'Kurtosis\'\'\': Kurtosis is the measure of ‘ *peaked-ness* ’ of distribution. It can be differentiating tool between distributions that have the same mean and variance. Higher kurtosis means a peak and fatter/extended tails. \n\nEach random variable has its own probability distribution that may have a similar shape to other variables, however, the structure will differ based on whether the variable is discrete or continuous, since probability distributions of continuous variables have an infinite number of values and probability functions of discrete variables assign a probability to each concrete data point. \n\n==2. Poisson Distribution==\nPoisson Distribution is one of the discrete probability distributions along with binomial, hypergeometric, and geometric distributions. The following table differentiates what applies where.\n{| class=""wikitable""\n|-\n! Distribution !! Definition\n|-\n| Binomial || It is used when there are two possible outcomes (success/failure) in a process that are independent of each other in n number of trials. The easiest example is a coin toss whereas a more practical use of binomial distribution is testing a drug, whether the drug cures the disease or not in n number of trials\n|-\n| Hypergeometric || It calculates the number of k successes in n number of trials where the probability of success changes with each passing trial. This kind of distribution applies in Poker when drawing a red card from the deck changes the probability of drawing another red card after it.\n|-\n| Poisson || It provides the probability of an event happening a certain number of times (k) within a given interval of time or space. For example, figuring out the probability of disease occurrence m times in the next month given that it occurs n times in 1 year.\n|-\n| Geometric || It determines the number of independent trials needed to get the first successful outcome. Geometric distribution may be used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a certain decision in a business.\n|}\n\nPoisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

Calculation and Probability Mass Function (PMF) Graph==\n\n===Probability Mass Function Graph===\n\n\'\'The Poisson distribution probability mass function (pmf) gives the probability of observing k events in a period given the length of the period and the average events per time.\'\'\n\n[[File:1 equation.PNG|center|250px]]\nT = Time interval \ne = natural logarithmic base \nk = number of events \nThe K! means K factorial. This means that we multiply all integers from K down to 1. Say K is 4 then K!= 4* 3* 2* 1= 24\n\nIntroducing lambda, λ, as a rate parameter (events/time)*T into the equation gives us \n[[File:2 equation.PNG|center]]\n\nSo, λ is basically the expected number of event occurrences in an interval, a function of \'\'\'number of events\'\'\' and the \'\'\'time interval\'\'\'. Changing λ means changing the probability of event occurrence in one interval.\n\nFor example, Ladislaus Bortkiewicz calculated the deaths of soldiers by horse kicks in the Prussian Army using Poisson Distribution in the late 1800s. He analyzed two decades of data from up to 10 army corps, equivalent to two centuries of observations for one army corps.\n[[File:Horse.png|center|500px]]\nFigure 1: Poisson Distribution for deaths by horse kick by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz.

Why is that the case?\n\nBy plotting the distribution of the original data using boxplots (on the left), we can see that the value range of data for the variables are vastly different. For example, the variable carbohydrates has much higher mean and variance compared to calories. By nature, PCA tries to form PCs where there is a widest spread in the data, so it will always prefer those variables with high ""absolute"" variance. It\'s like comparing 1000 milliseconds and 5 kilometers and putting more weight on the 1000 milliseconds because 1000 is bigger than 5.\n\n[[File: PCA_BoxPlot.png|center|700px]]\n\nThis is why standardization, or sometimes called feature scaling (scale data to mean 0 and standard deviation 1) is a crucial pre-processing step in many data analysis procedures and machine learning algorithms, including PCA.

After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes\' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances.

Source: own.]]\n\n\'\'\'The use of scenarios as a tool for structured thinking about the future dates back to the Manhattan Project in the early 1940s\'\'\'. The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were ""(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]"" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).\n\n\'\'\'Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.\'\'\' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally ""(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude."" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the ""Unified Planning Machinery"". The idea was to listen to planners\' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell\'s management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell\'s success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2). \n\nToday, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders\' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nScenario Planning is the systematic development of descriptions of (typically multiple) plausible futures, which are then called ""scenarios"". These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them ""(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion."" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all ""fundamentally different"" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios ""(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties."" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).\n\n\'\'\'There is no \'\'one\'\' procedure for Scenario Planning\'\'\' (5). A commonly cited approach by Schoemaker (2, 3) includes the following steps:<br>\n1) Definition of time frame, scope, decision variables and major actors of the issue in question.\n\n2) Identification of current trends and predetermined elements and how they influence the defined decision variables, based on the knowledge of experts and the available data. It should be observed whether major trends are compatible with each other and which uncertainties exist. \n\n3) Construction of extreme future states along a specific continuum (positive vs negative, probable vs surprising, continuous vs divergent etc.) for all the elements or variables. These extremes are then assessed for their internal consistency and plausibility in terms of stakeholder decisions, trends and outcomes.']"|0.14|1.0

His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued ""against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions."" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|\'\'\'Moreno\'s original work on Social Networks.\'\'\' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]\n\nRomanian-American psychosociologist \'\'\'Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s\'\'\' with his - and his collaborator Helen Jennings\' - \'sociometry\', which served ""(...) as a way of conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction."" (Scott 1988, p.110). Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).\n\nMoreno\'s and Jennings\' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of \'\'\'\'group dynamics\', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.\'\'\' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. ""The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties."" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n""Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm."" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that ""(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. \'\'\'Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.""\'\'\' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as ""entitites"", ""actors"", ""vertices"" or ""agents"" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are ""(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations"" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be ""(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection"" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.']"|0.125|0.5
46|What are the limitations of Stacked Area Plots?|Stacked Area Plots are not suitable for studying the evolution of individual data series.|"['\'\'\'Note:\'\'\' This entry revolves specifically around Stacked Area plots. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n\'\'\'In short:\'\'\' \nThis entry aims to introduce Stacked Area Plot and its visualization using R’s <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>ggplot2</syntaxhighlight> package. A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>geom_area()</syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>geom_area()</syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n\'\'\'Syntax\'\'\': <syntaxhighlight lang=""R"" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()</syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

Source: own.]]\n\n\'\'\'The Thought Experiment may well be the oldest scientific method.\'\'\' The consideration of potential futures was a vital step when our distant ancestors emancipated themselves and became humans. Asking themselves the \'\'What if\'\' questions was a vital step in the dawn of humankind, and both in the West and the East many of the first thinkers are known to have engaged in Thought Experiments. Methodologically, Thought Experiments provide a link between the metaphysical - or philosophy - and the natural world - i.e. natural sciences. Ancient Greece as well as Buddhism and Hinduism are full of early examples of Thought Experiments. Aristoteles remains a first vital step in the West, and after a long but slow growth of the importance of the methods, he represents a bridge into the early [[History of Methods|enlightenment]]. Galileo and Newton are early examples of famous Thought Experiments that connect theoretical considerations with a systematic reflection of the natural world. This generation of more generalisable laws was more transgressed with the \'\'Origin of Species\'\' by Charles Darwin. This theory was initially one epic Thought Experiment, and although DNA initially confirmed it, the role of epigenetics was another step that proved rather problematic for Darwinism. Mach introduced the term ""Thought Experiment"", and Lichtenberg created a more systematic exploration of thought experiments. Many ethical Thought Experiments gained province in the 20st century, and Derek Parfit is a prominent example how these experiments are used to illustrate and argument cases and examples within ethics.\n\n== What the method does ==\nThought Experiments are the philosophical method that asks the ""What if"" questions in a systematic sense. Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word ""experiment"" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.  \n\nThe easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a ""What if"" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers of variations of this experiment exist (see Further Information), as it can teach much about choice, ethics, and responsibility. For instance, many people would change the train direction, but hardly anyone would push a person onto the track to derail the train. This would save the other five, and the outcome would be the same. However the difference between pushing a lever or pushing a person has deep psychological ramifications that resolve around guilt. This exemplifies that the Thought Experiment does not necessarily have a \'\'best\'\' outcome, as the outcome depends - in this example - on your moral choices. Some might argue that you should hurl yourself onto the track to stop the train, thereby not changing the countable outcome, but performing a deeply altruistic act that saves everybody else. Most people would probably be unable to do this.']"|0.23529411764705882|1.0
48|What is temporal autocorrelation?|Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future.|"['Values in the shaded region are statistically not significant, so there is a chance higher than 5% that there is no autocorrelation.\n\n===Detecting and Replacing Outliers===\nIn time series data, there are often outliers skewing the distributions, trends, or periodicity. There are multiple approaches to detecting and dealing with outliers in time series data. We will have a look at detecting outliers first: 1. Distribution-based outlier detection: This detection method relies on the assumption that the data follows a certain known distribution. Then all points outside this distribution are considered outliers. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 2. Distance-based outlier detection: This method computes the distance from one point to all other points. A point is considered “close” to another point when the distance between them is below a set threshold. Then, a point is considered an outlier if the fraction of points deemed close to that point is below a threshold. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 3. Local outlier factor (LOF): The local outlier factor (LOF) is a measure of how anomalous an object is within a dataset, based on the density of its local neighborhood. The LOF is computed by comparing the density of an object\'s neighborhood to the densities of the neighborhoods of its nearest neighbors. If the density of an object\'s neighborhood is significantly lower than the densities of its neighbors\' neighborhoods, then it is considered an outlier (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n1. is best to use when you have an idea of the distribution of your data, ideally if the data is normally distributed. This is especially the case for very large datasets.\n\n2. Is best when you expect outliers spread across the distribution, but you don\'t know the distribution.\n\n3. Is best when you want to identify outliers in clusters or in varying densities because you compare the data points to their neighbors. To decide, you can assess the distribution visually. For a better overview of the different approaches to handling outliers in general, see [[Outlier_Detection_in_Python|here]].\nIn general, many outlier detection methods are available ready-to-use in numerous python packages. This is an example of using the local outlier factor from the package scikit-learn:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports the necessary packages for visualization.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor ## imports the function for the local outlier function \n\nlof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=20, contamination=.03)## considers 20 neighboured data points and expects 3% of the data to be outliers (see contamination)\nprediction = lof.fit_predict(df[\'usage_kwh\'].to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1))## transforms the electricity usage columns to a NumPy array (""to_numpy()"") and reshapes it to a single column (""reshape (-1, 1)""), fit.predict then predicts the outliers (outlier if the prediction = -1)\ndf[\'outlier\'] = prediction == -1 ## creates a new column in the initial dataframe called an outlier, with true or false, depending on whether it is an outlier or not\n\noutliers = df[df[\'outlier\']] ## creates  a column where only outliers are selected\n\nplt.plot(df[\'usage_kwh\']) ## plots the dataframe\nplt.scatter(x=outliers.index, y=outliers[\'usage_kwh\'], color=\'tab:red\', marker=\'x\') ## creates a scatter plot with the outliers, marked with a red x\nplt.title(\'Outliers in the dataset (marked in red)\') ## title of the plot\nplt.xlabel(\'Date\') ## titlex axis\nplt.ylabel(\'Usage (KWh)\')## title y axis\nplt.show()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:outlier plot.png|700px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 7: Outlier in the chosen part of the dataset (marked with red cross)</small>\n\nIn this case, these are probably false-positive outliers. The dataset is already pretty clean and does likely not contain many outliers.\n\nThe imputation of missing values is the next challenge after detecting outliers. The naive solution to this problem is to replace a missing point with the mean of all points. While this approach will not skew the data distribution significantly, the imputed values might be far off from the actual value and make messy graphics. An alternative is applying regression models that use predictive models to estimate missing points.\n\nA combined approach to both detects and replaces outliers is the Kalman Filter, which predicts new points based on the previous points and estimates a noise measure for new points. Thus, when an anomaly is detected, it is replaced by the prediction from the model using historical data (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n===Forecasting Time Series Data===\n\nForecasting time series data can be of tremendous value in information gain. Since this is a large topic, this article will only touch on one method for forecasting: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models, or ARIMA for short. It consists of three parts:\n\n* The autoregressive (AR) component, which models the autocorrelation of the time series\n* The integrated (I) component, which models the non-stationary bits of the time series\n* The moving average (MA) component, which models the noise or error in the time series.\n\nEach component requires an appropriate selection of parameters. Choosing the right parameters can yield a powerful model. However, finding good values of the parameters can be difficult and requires further complicated techniques.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\nimport statsmodels.api as sm ## needed to employ ARIMA']"|0.017241379310344827|0.0
