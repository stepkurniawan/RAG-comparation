First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.","'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==A\/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA\/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content. This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A\/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A\/B tests, the scheme of [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|scientific experiments]] is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.\n\n==Planning Phase==\nDuring the planning phase, a goal and hypothesis are formulated, and a study design is developed that specifies the sample size, the duration of the study, and the metrics to be measured. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of the test.\n\n===Goal Definition===\nThe goal identifies problems or optimization potential to improve the software product.

Extensions have been developed later on in this regard, with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.","Furthermore, many researchers use the ANOVA today in an inductive sense. With more and more data becoming available, even from completely undersigned sampling sources, the ANOVA becomes the analysis of choice if the difference between different factor levels is investigated for a continuous variable. Due to the [[Glossary|emergence]] of big data, these applications could be seen critical, since no real hypothesis are being tested. Instead, the statistician becomes a gold digger, searching the vastness of the available data for patterns, [[Causality#Correlation_is_not_Causality|may these be causal or not]]. While there are numerous benefits, this is also a source of problems. Non-designed datasets will for instance not be able to test for the impact a drug might have on a certain diseases. This is a problem, as systematic knowledge production is almost assumed within the ANOVA, but its application these days is far away from it. The inductive and the deductive world become intertwined, and this poses a risk for the validity of scientific results.\n\nFor more on the Analysis of Variance, please refer to the [[ANOVA]] entry.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Guinea pig computer.jpg|thumb|right|The tooth growth of guinea pigs is a good R data set to illustrate how the ANOVA works]]\n===Toothgrowth of guinea pigs===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#To find out, what the ToothGrowth data set is about: ?ToothGrowth\n\n#The code is partly from boxplot help (?boxplot).

This statistical test is - mechanically speaking - comparing the means of more than two groups by extending the restriction of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Two_sample_t-test|t-test]]. Comparing different groups became thus a highly important procedure in the design of experiments, which is, apart from laboratories, also highly relevant in greenhouse experiments in ecology, where conditions are kept stable through a controlled environment. \n\nThe general principle of the ANOVA is rooted in [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. An idealized null hypothesis is formulated against which the data is being tested. If the ANOVA gives a significant result, then the null hypothesis is rejected, hence it is statistically unlikely that the data confirms the null hypothesis. As one gets an overall p-value, it can be thus confirmed whether the different groups differ overall. Furthermore, the ANOVA allows for a measure beyond the p-value through the '''sum of squares calculations''' which derive how much is explained by the data, and how large in relation the residual or unexplained information is.\n\n====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes.

Here there are only two options: head or tail.]]\n\n'''Centuries ago, Thomas Bayes proposed a dramatically different approach'''. Here, an imperfect or a small sample would serve as basis for statistical interference. Very crudely defined, the two approaches start at exact opposite ends. While frequency statistics demand preconditions such as sample size and a normal distribution for specific statistical tests, Bayesian statistics build on the existing sample size; all calculations base on what is already there. Experts may excuse my dramatic simplification, but one could say that frequentist statistics are top-down thinking, while [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach\/ Bayesian statistics] work bottom-up. The history of modern science is widely built on frequentist statistics, which includes such approaches as methodological design, sampling density and replicates, and diverse statistical tests. It is nothing short of a miracle that Bayes proposed the theoretical foundation for the theory named after him more than 250 years ago. Only with the rise of modern computers was this theory explored deeply, and builds the foundation of branches in data science and machine learning. The two approaches are also often coined as objectivists for frequentist probability fellows, and subjectivists for folllowers of [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes theorem].","There is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances. Especially for predictive modeling and small data problems, Bayesian approaches should be preferred, as well as for tough cases that defy the standard array of statistical distributions. Let us hope for a future where we surely know how to toss a coin. For more on this, please refer to the entry on [[Non-equilibrium dynamics]].\n\n== Outlook ==\nBayesian methods have been central in a variety of domains where outcomes are probabilistic in nature; fields such as engineering, medicine, finance, etc. heavily rely on Bayesian methods to make forecasts. Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future.","== Bayes Theorem ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. However, this coin comes with a flip side\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands."],"3":["'''What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency.''' Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional acts per se. Still, consequentialism and a focus on mere actions is also relevant because it allows to step away from a single agent and focus instead on the interactions within the agency of several actors, which is a good start for the next concept.","The investigation of complex system has thrived in the last decades, both from an empirical as well as from a conceptual perspective. Many methods emerged or were subsequently adapted to answer questions as well as explore relations, and this thrive towards a deeper understanding of systems is at least one important difference to agency from a methodological standpoint. Much novel data is available, and often inductively explored. The scale of complex systems makes an intervention with a focus on [[Causality and correlation|causality]] a challenge, hence many investigated relations are purely correlative. Take for instance social media, or economic flows, which can be correlatively investigated, yet causality is an altogether different matter. This creates a methodological challenge, since many of our questions regarding human systems are normative, which is why many researchers assume causality in their investigations, or at least discuss relations as if these are causal. Another methodological problem related to causality are non-linear relations, since much of the statistical canon is based on probability and linear relations. While linear relations allow for a better inference of causal explanations, the long existing yet until recently hardly explored [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics are an example that we can inductively learn about systems at a growing pace without being dependent on linearity or normal-distributions. This Bayesian revolution is currently under way, but much of the disciplines relying on statistics did not catch up on this yet. Other methodological approaches will certainly be explored to gain insight into the nuts and bolts of complex systems, yet this is only slowly emerging.","We have to conclude that our observational powers as well as the deviance of the real world from our expectations do not always give us sufficient reason for rules we can agree upon. We therefore need to take the intention of our actions into account, and thereby modify our viewpoint. Instead of a rule based world view or an act consequentialists world view we need to settle on an intention based worldview, where no one objects our intentions. Our intentions may follow certain rules, which in many cases cannot be neglected to give some general guideline. If we thus continue to agree to act based on certain rules, we equally need to teach the capacity or allow within a system to deviate from certain rules. This would allow both a reflexive setting as well as a clear documentation of the intentions of our actions, something that may seem hard to imagine for many today, yet may in the future just become a modus operandi towards transparency and evaluative competency. Naturally, we shall not need to write down everything we do, yet focus on these acts that actually have consequences. While this is hard to anticipate now, and we need to be aware even of very small, accumulated and interacting consequences, we shall for now lump sum this as part of the epistemological mist we will need to clear in the future, but not here."],"4":["Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework. More on this point later.

Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong.","==== Not normally distributed dependent variable ====\n'''The dependent variable(s) is\/are not normally distributed.'''

Search terms: 'Clustering', 'Cluster Analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nCluster analysis shares history in various fields such as anthropology, psychology, biology, medicine, business, computer science, and social science.","It originated in anthropology when Driver and Kroeber published Quantitative Expression of Cultural Relationships in 1932 where they sought to clusters of [[Glossary|culture]] based on different culture elements. Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as ''similarity measure'' or ''distance measure'', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named \"unsupervised learning\", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term \"clustering\" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.\n\n== Data Simulation ==\nThis article deals with simulated data. This section contains the function used to simulate the data. For the purpose of this article, the data has three clusters. You need to load the function on your R environment in order to simulate the data and perform clustering.","[[File:Result of K-Means Clustering (High Variance).png| |Result of K-Means Clustering (High Variance)]]\n\n==== Strengths and Weaknesses of k-Means Clustering ====\n\n'''Strengths'''\n* It is intuitive to understand.\n* It is relatively easy to implement.\n* It adapts to new data points and guarantees convergence.\n\n'''Weaknesses'''\n* The number of clusters ''k'' has to be chosen manually.\n* The vanilla k-Means algorithm cannot accommodate cases with a high number of clusters (high ''k'').\n* The k-Means clustering algorithm clusters ''all'' the data points. As a result, the centroids are affected by outliers.\n* As the dimension of the dataset increases, the performance of the algorithm starts to deteriorate.\n\n=== Hierarchical Clustering ===\nAs the name suggests, hierarchical clustering is a clustering method that builds a ''hierarchy'' of clusters. \n\nUnlike k-means clustering algorithms - as discussed above -, this clustering method does not require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand. As a result, this method is sometimes used to identify the number of clusters that a dataset has before applying other clustering algorithms that require us to specify the number of clusters at the beginning.\n\nThere are two strategies when performing hierarchical clustering:\n\n==== Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering ====\n\nThis is a \"bottom-up\" approach of building hierarchy which starts by treating each data point as a single cluster, and successively merging pairs of clusters, or agglomerating, until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data points. Each observation belongs to its own cluster, then pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.\n\n==== Implementation of Agglomerative Clustering ====\nThe first example of agglomerative clustering is performed using the hclust function built in to R."],"7":["* '''Data Collection''': When the research focus is chosen, the data necessary for Social Network Analysis can be gathered in [[Survey Research|Surveys]] or [[Interviews]], through [[Ethnography|Observation]], [[Content Analysis]] (typically literature-based) or similar forms of data gathering. Surveys and Interviews are most common, with the researchers asking individuals about the existence and strength of connections between themselves and others actors, or within other actors excluding themselves (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14). There are two common approaches when surveying individuals about their own connections to others: In a ''prompted recall'' approach, they are asked which people they would think of with regards to a specific topic (e.g. \"To whom would you go for advice at work?\") while they are shown a pre-determined list of potentially relevant individuals. In the ''free list'' approach, they are asked to recall individuals without seeing a list (Butts 2008, p.20f).\n* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.","==== Step by Step ====\n* '''Type of Network:''' First, Social Network Analysts decide whether they intend to focus on a holistic view on the network (''whole networks''), or focus on the network surrounding a specific node of interest (''ego networks''). They also decide for either ''one-mode networks'', focusing on one type of node that could be connected with any other; or ''two-mode networks'' where there are two types of nodes, with each node unable to be connected with another node of the same type (Marin & Wellman 2010, 13). For a two-mode network, you could imagine an analysis of social events and the individuals that visit these, where each event is not connected to another event, but only to other individuals; and vice-versa.\n* '''Network boundaries:''' In a next step, the approach to defining nodes needs to be chosen. Three ways of defining networks can be named according to Marin & Wellman (2010, p.2, referring to Laumann et al. (1983)). These three are approaches not mutually exclusive and may be combined:\n** ''position-based approach'': considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally-defined positions to be network members, and all others would be excluded\n** ''event-based'' approach: those who had participated in key events are believed to define the population\n** ''relation-based approach'': begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.\n** Butts (2008) adds the ''exogenously defined boundaries'', which are pre-determined based on the research intent or theory which provide clearly specified entities of interest.","Social Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.'''

The data must convey a message to the receiver and be durable (2, 3). Often, Content Analysis focuses on data that are difficult or impossible to interpret with other methods (3). The data may exist 'naturally' and be publicly available, for example verbal discourse, written documents, or visual representations from mass media (newspapers, books, films, comics etc.); or be rather unavailable to the public, such as personal letters or witness accounts. The data may also be generated for the research purpose (e.g. interview transcripts) (1, 2, 4).  \n\nWhile there is a wide range of qualitative Content Analysis approaches, this entry will focus on joint characteristics of these. For more information on the different variations, please refer to Schreier (2014) in the Key Publications.","== Normativity ==\n==== Quality Criteria ====\n* Reliability is difficult to maintain in the Content Analysis. A clear and unambiguous definition of codes as well as testings for inter-coder reliability represent attempts to ensure inter-subjectivity and thus stability and reproducibility (3, 4). However, the ambiguous nature of the data demands an interpretative analysis process - especially in the qualitative approach. This interpretation process of the texts or contents may interfere with the intended inter-coder reliability.\n* Validity of the inferred results - i.e. the fitting of the results to the intended kind of knowledge - may be reached a) through the researchers' knowledge of contextual factors of the data and b) through validation with other sources, e.g. by the means of triangulation. However, the latter can be difficult to do due to the uniqueness of the data (1-3). Any content analysis is a reduction of the data, which should be acknowledged critically, and which is why the coding scheme should be precise and include the aforementioned explanation, examples and exclusion criteria.\n\n==== Connectedness ====\n* Since verbal discourse is an important data source for Content Analysis, the latter is often used as an analysis method of transcripts of standardized, [[Open Interview|open]], or [[Semi-structured Interview|semi-structured interviews]].\n* Content Analysis is one form of textual analysis. The latter also includes other approaches such as discourse analysis, rhetorical analysis, or [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis (2). However, Content Analysis differs from these methods in terms of methodological elements and the kinds of questions it addresses (2).","== What the method does ==\nContent Analysis is a \"(...) systematic, replicable technique for compressing many words of text into fewer content categories based on explicit rules of coding\" (Stemler 2000, p.1).

The mostly qualitative data material is assessed by creating a category system relevant to the material, and attributing parts of the content to individual categories (Schreier 2014). Not only the content of a source is evaluated, but also formal aspects as well as contextual psychological, institutional, and cultural elements of the communication process (1, 4). \"[Content Analysis] seeks to analyze data within a specific context in view of the meanings someone - a group or a culture - attributes to them.\" (Krippendorff 1989, p.403).

This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables. They show every observation as a dot in the graph and the further the dots scatter, the less they explain. The position of the dot on the x- and y-axis represent the values of the two numeric variables.\n[[File:MilesHorsePower2.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]","== What the method does ==\nCorrelation analysis examines the relationship between two [[Data formats|continuous variables]], and test whether the relation is statistically significant. For this, correlation analysis takes the sample size and the strength of the relation between the two variables into account. The so-called ''correlation coefficient'' indicates the strength of the relation, and ranges from -1 to 1. A coefficient close to 0 indicates a weak correlation. A coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, and a coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. \n\nCorrelations can be applied to all kinds of quantitative continuous data from all spatial and temporal scales, from diverse methodological origins including [[Survey]]s and Census data, ecological measurements, economical measurements, GIS and more. Correlations are also used in both inductive and deductive approaches. This versatility makes correlation analysis one of the most frequently used quantitative methods to date.\n\n'''There are different forms of correlation analysis.''' The Pearson correlation is usually applied to normally distributed data, or more precisely, data that shows a [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/students-t-distribution\/ Student's t-distribution]. Alternative correlation measures like [https:\/\/www.statisticssolutions.com\/kendalls-tau-and-spearmans-rank-correlation-coefficient\/ Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho] are usually applied to variables that are not normally distributed.

To this day, such a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem remains a reason to choose Delphi. Delphi may also be an appropriate choice if the collective subjective judgment by the experts is beneficial to the problem-solving process (2, 4, 5, 6).\n* Delphi can be used as a form of group counseling when other forms, such as face-to-face interactions between multiple stakeholders, are not feasible or even detrimental to the process due to counterproductive group dynamics (4, 5).\n* The value of the Delphi method is that it reveals clearly those ideas that are the reason for disagreements between stakeholders, and those that are consensual (5).\n* Delphi can be \"(...) a highly motivating experience for participants\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309) due to the feedback on the group's opinions that is provided in subsequent questioning stages.\n* The Delphi method with its feedback characteristic has advantages over direct confrontation of the experts, which \"(...) all too often induces the hasty formulation of preconceived notions, an inclination to close one's mind to novel ideas, a tendency to defend a stand once taken, or, alternatively and sometimes alternately, a predisposition to be swayed by persuasively stated opinions of others.\" (Okoli & Pawlowski 2004, p.2, after Dalkey & Helmer)\n* Additionally, Delphi provides several advantages over traditional surveys:\n** Studies have shown that averages of group responses are superior to averages of individual responses.

While some problems are still easy to solve, others are not. Due to the complex phenomena of globalisation we now face challenges that are truly spanning across the globe, and may as well affect the whole globe. Globalisation once started with the promise of a creation of a united and connected humankind. This is of course a very naive worldview and, as we see today, has failed in many regards. Instead, we see a rise in global inequality in terms of many indicators, among them [https:\/\/www.gapminder.org\/tools\/#$chart-type=bubbles global wealth distribution].

However, the current challenges demand a new mode of science; one that is radical yet rooted in long traditions, collaborative yet able to focus deeply on specific parts of knowledge, solution orientated yet"],"19":["Coming back to bias, '''Critical Theory seems as an antidote to bias''', and some may argue Critical Realism even more so, as it combines the criticality with a certain humbleness necessary when exploring the empirical and causal. The explanatory characteristic allowed by Critical Realism might be good enough for the pragmatist, the practical may speak to the modern engagement of science with and for society, and the normative is aware of \u2013 well - all things normative, including the critical. Hence a door was opened to a new mode of science, focussing on the situation and locatedness of research within the world. This was surely a head start with Kant, who opened the globe to the world of methods. There is however a critical link in Habermas, who highlighted the duality of the rational individual on a small scale and the role of global societies as part of the economy (Habermas 1987). This underlines a crucial link to the original three foundational theories in philosophy, albeit in a dramatic and focused interpretation of modernity. Habermas himself was well aware of the tensions between these two approaches \u2013 the critical and the empirical -, yet we owe it to Critical Theory and its continuations that a practical and reflexive knowledge production can be conducted within deeply normative systems such as modern democracies.","Linking to the historical development of methods, we can thus clearly claim that Critical Theory (and Critical Realism) opened a new domain or mode of thinking, and its impact can be widely felt way beyond the social science and philosophy that it affected directly. However, coming back to bias, the answer to an almost universal rejection of empiricism will [[Big problems for later|not be followed here]]. Instead, we need to come back to the three foundational theories of philosophy, and need to acknowledge that reason, social contract and utilitarianism are the foundation of the first empirical disciplines that are at their core normative (e.g. psychology, social and political science, and economics). Since bias can be partly related to these three theories, and consequentially to specific empirical disciplines, we need to recognise that there is an overarching methodological bias. This methodological bias has a signature rooted in specific design criteria, which are in turn related to specific disciplines. Consequently, this methodological bias is a disciplinary bias - even more so, since methods may be shared among scientific disciplines, but most disciplines claim either priority or superiority when it comes to the ownership of a method.","The disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.","System Thinking can be applied in any discipline to understand underlying structures and develop models of the system that is analysed. However, sustainability science relies heavily on System Thinking since it acknowledges the complex and lagged interrelationships within and in between ecological, economic, social and further systems. A Key Publication in this field was 'Thinking in Systems' by '''Donella Meadows''', who had been co-authoring the landmark 'Limits to Growth' before. Sustainability Science, which attempts to bridge the world how it is with the world how it ought to be, relies on System Thinking to understand how the world is and in which '[[Glossary|leverage points]]' one needs to intervene to bring about change. System Thinking can also be applied outside of scientific research, e.g. to analyze company-internal processes, for marketing purposes etc. (see e.g. 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nBefore explaining System Thinking, it should first be explained what is a 'system'.\n\n==== Systems, System Thinking, System Analysis & System Dynamics ====\nA system is a \"(...) network of multiple variables that are connected to each other through causal relationships\", based on which the network \"(...) expresses some sort of behaviour, which can only be characterized through observation as a whole\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.11). This behavior remains persistent in a variety of circumstances. More simply put, a system is a \"(...) collection of connected things (...) that influence one another.\" (Toole 2005, p.2) Both the collection of elements and their interactions are important elements of the system which is emphasized by saying that a system is 'more than a collection of its parts' (Arnold & Wade 2015, p.2).","''System Dynamics'', then, focuses on the interaction part of the system. It \"(...) refers to the re-creation of the understanding of a system and its feedbacks. It aims at exploring dynamic responses to changes within or from outside the system. (...) System Dynamics deals with mathematical representation of our mental models and is a secondary step after we have developed our mental model.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). System Dynamics, as the name suggests, enables the researcher to observe and measure the behavior of the system. The interactions between the individual elements are not just recreated, but the consequences of these interactions are quantified and assessed.\n\nSystem Thinking allows for a shift in the perception of [[Causality|causality]]. Instead of assuming linear causality (A causes B, B causes C) it allows for the integration of further influencing factors, as well as a more neutral depiction of the system at hand. C may now be seen as a property that [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|emerges]] from the relation between A and B, instead of perceiving it as a direct consequence of B. Haraldsson (2004, p.21) provides an illustrative example here: \"We start by asking the initial question: \"I want to understand how water flows into the glass and what I do to fill it up.\" Instead of looking at the action from an individual point of view, where the \"I am\" is the active part and at the centre of focus, we shift our perception to the structure of the action. The \"I am\" simply becomes a part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. Suddenly we have shifted out attention to the structure of the behavior and we can observe that the structure is causing the behavior. (...) We have now transformed the traditional linear thinking into a circular argument.\""],"21":["{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || '''[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]''' || '''[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n''Teaching is the best way to learn.''\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:","# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it. Congratulations!","Im Spannungsfeld zwischen neuen Paradigmen und der bestehenden Methodik kann eine Anpassung bestehender Methoden oder eine Entwicklung g\u00e4nzlich neuer Methoden erforderlich sein.

Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical","When designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results. Subsequently, ANOVA experiments became more complex, combining several independent variables and also allowing to correct for so called random factors, which are elements for which the variance is calculated out of the ANOVA model. This allows for instance to increase the sample size to minimise the effects of the variance in an agricultural experiment which is being conducted on several agricultural fields. In this example, agricultural fields are then included as block factor, which allows to minimise the variance inferred by these replications. Hence, the variance of the agricultural fields is tamed by a higher number of replicates. This led to the ANOVA becoming one of the most relevant methods in statistics, yet recent developments such as the reproducibility crisis in psychology highlight that care needs to be taken to not overplay ones hand. Preregistering hypotheses and more recognition of the [[Limitations of Statistics|limitations]] of such designs currently pave a path towards a more critical future of statistical designs. \n\nAnother development that emerged during the last decades is the conducting of so called real-world experiments, which are often singular case studies with interventions, yet typically less or no control of variables. These approaches are slowly being developed in diverse branches of research, and allow to open a [[Meta-Analysis|meta-analytical]] dimension, where a high number of case studies is averaged in terms of the research results. The combination of different studies enables a different perspective, yet currently such approaches are either restricted to rigid clinical trials or to meta-analyses with more variables than cases.","==== Random factors ====\nThis brings us to the next factor that can affect our model validity. There are many things we might want to know when creating a statistical model, but there may also be things that we do not want to know. Statistically speaking, these are ''random factors'' or ''random variables''. Regarding these, we explicitly exclude the variance that is created by these parts of the dataset, because we want to minimise their effects. An example would be a medical study that wants to investigate the effect of a certain drug on the recovery rate of some diseased patients. In such studies, the information whether a patient is a smoker or not is often included as a random factor, because smoking negatively affects many diseases and the respective recovery rates. We know that smoking makes many things worse (from a medical standpoint) and this is why such variables are excluded. More on random factors can be found [[ Field_experiments#Fixed_effects_vs._Random_effects | here]].\n\n==== The model ====\nThe next part of a [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis | statistical model]] that needs to be examined when discussing the limitations of statistics is the statistical test or model itself. Models differ in terms of their mathematical foundations. This can lead to some models being more complicated than others, relying on different measures of model performance, and are also sometimes differently utilised within different scientific communities or disciplines.

While real world experiments emerged some decades ago already, they are only starting to gain wider recognition. All the while, the reproducibility crisis challenges the classical laboratory and field experiments, as a wider recognition that many results - for instance from psychological studies - cannot be reproduced. All this indicates that while much of our scientific knowledge is derived from experiments, much remains to be known, also about the conduct of experiments themselves.","Field experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and","and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments.

Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong.","[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.","==== Not normally distributed dependent variable ====\n'''The dependent variable(s) is\/are not normally distributed.'''

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.","==Explanation of used arguments==\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Colv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Rowv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> are used to remove the dendrograms from rows and columns. A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects and is added on top of the heatmap by default if the argument is not specified. The main reason for removing it here is that it is a different method of data visualisation which is not mandatory for the heatmap representation and requires a separate article to review it fully.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>scale = \u201ccolumn\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to normalize the columns of the matrix (to absorb the variation between columns). As it was stated previously, normalization is needed due to the algorithm by which the colors are set. Here in our dataset, the values of features \u201cGross horsepower\u201d and \u201cDisplacement\u201d are much larger than the rest. Therefore, without normalization, these two columns will be all marked approximately equally high and all the other columns equally low. Normalizing means that we keep the relative values in each column but not the real numbers. In the interpretation sense it means that, for example, the same color of features \u201cMiles per Gallon\u201d and \u201cNumber of Cylinders\u201d of Mazda RX4 does not mean that the actual values are the same or approximately the same (placed in the same bin). It only means that the relative values of each of these cells in corresponding columns are the same or are in the same bin.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>margins<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to fit the columns and rows names into the graph. The reason we used it here is because of the renaming of the columns, which is resulted in longer names that did not fit well by themselves.","It also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting.

Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on '''the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.'''","Viele konkrete Schritte brachten uns der konkreten Anwendung wissenschaftlicher Methoden n\u00e4her, darunter - insbesondere - der Ansatz des kontrollierten Testens durch den arabischen Mathematiker und Astronomen [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a.

'''By observing nature and its phenomena, we are able to derive conclusion based on the particular.''' Bacon is thus often coined to be the father of 'the scientific method', an altogether misleading term, as there are many scientific methods. However, empiricism, meaning the empirical investigation of phenomena and the derivation of results or even rules triggered a scientific revolution, and also a specialization of different scientific branches. While Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had been a polymath less than a century ago, Bacon (1561-1626) triggered an increase in empirical inquiry that led to the deeper formation of scientific disciplines. Many others contributed to this development: [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/locke\/ Locke] claimed that human knowledge builds on experience, and [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/hume\/ Hume] propelled this into skepticism, casting the spell of doubt on anything that is rooted in belief or dogma. By questioning long standing knowledge, science kicked in - among other things - the door of god himself, a circumstance that is too large to be presented here in any sense. What is important however is that - starting from the previous age of diverse approaches to knowledge - the combination of empiricism on the one end, and the associated philosophical developments on the other end, the age of reason had dawned.\n\n[[File:Timeline of methods V2.jpg|600px|frame|center|'''A timeline of major breakthroughs in science.'''

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.","'''We need to choose and apply methods depending on the type of knowledge we aim to create, regardless of the disciplinary background or tradition.''' We should aim to become more and more experienced and empowered to use the method that is most ideal for each research purpose and not rely solely on what our discipline has always been doing. In order to achieve this, design criteria of methods can help to create a conceptualization of the nature of methods. In other words: what are the underlying principles that guide the available scientific methods? First, we need to start with the most fundamental question:\n\n\n== What are scientific methods? ==\nGenerally speaking, ''scientific methods create knowledge''. This knowledge creation process follows certain principles and has a certain rigour. Knowledge that is created through scientific methods should be ideally [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/scientific-reproducibility\/ ''reproducible''], which means that someone else under the given circumstances would come up with the same insights when using the same respective methods. This is insofar important, as other people would maybe create different data under a similar setting, but all the data should answer research questions or hypotheses in the same way. However, there are some methods that may create different knowledge patterns, which is why documentation is pivotal in the application of scientific methods. Some forms of knowledge, such as the perception of individuals, cannot be reproduced, because these are singular perspectives. '''Knowledge created through scientific methods hence either follows a systematic application of methods, or a systematic documentation of the application of methods'''. Reproducible approaches create the same knowledge, and other approaches should be equally well documented to safeguard that for all steps taken it can be understood what was being done precisely.","The course '''Scientific methods - Different paths to knowledge''' introduces the learner to the fundamentals of scientific work. It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry.

Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]"],"32":["== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having \"no mind\", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you.

The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.","Mindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets.

Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know.","== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: '''Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and\/or continuous]] independent variables'''. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.","Another very important point regarding Mixed Effect Models is that they - probably more than any statistical method - remark the point where experts in one method (say for example interviews) now needed to learn how to conduct interviews as a scientific method, but also needed to learn advanced statistics in the form of Mixed Effect Models.

Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values.","== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.","reduction is preferable to reporting full models\", I mean myself and likeminded scientists. This is a deeply normative statement rooted in my experience and the experience of other scientist, and therefore ideally deserves further explanation. Consequently, I might write something to the end of \"by avoiding p-values and building my model reduction on AIC values, the reported statistic model are more robust under the criteria of parsimony\"."],"37":["=== Redundancy analysis ===","The simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant.","The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure.

Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.","Narrative Research is \"(...) the study of stories\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus \"(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.\" (Moen 2006, p.56). The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014).\n\n'''One common approach in Narrative Research is the usage of narratives in form of spoken or written text or other types of media as the data material for analysis.''' This understanding is comparable to [[Content Analysis]] or [[Hermeneutics]]. A second understanding focuses on the creation of narratives as part of the methodological design, so that the narrative material is not pre-developed but emerges from the inquiry itself (Squire et al. 2014, Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000). In both approaches, 'narrative' is the underlying \"frame of reference\" (Moen 2006, p.57) for the research. An example for the latter understanding is the 'Narrative Interview'.\n\n==== Narrative Interviews ====\n[[File:Narrative Research Phases.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Basic phases of the narrative Interview.''' Source: Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.5.]]","Narrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006)."],"39":["[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.","== The chaos increases ==\nThis brings us now to the second point: what are current models that try to take non-equilibrium dynamics into account? The most simple models are [[Correlations]] and [[Regression Analysis|Regressions]], with 'time' as the independent variable in the case of regressions, or just look at simple temporal correlations concerning temporal dynamics. Since such models either build on linear dynamics of blunt rank statistics, it is clear that such approaches must fail when it comes to taking non-linear dynamics into account. '''Non-equilibrium dynamics are more often than not characterised by non-linear patterns, which need us to step out of the world of linear dynamics.''' \n\nOver the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the patterns that are being modeled. '''In other words, GAMs are able to increase the model fit or predictive power, but in the worst case, we are throwing our means to understand or explain the existing relations out of the window.'''","Since not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution."],"40":["==2.

The following table differentiates what applies where.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Distribution !!

This kind of distribution applies in Poker when drawing a red card from the deck changes the probability of drawing another red card after it.\n|-\n| Poisson || It provides the probability of an event happening a certain number of times (k) within a given interval of time or space. For example, figuring out the probability of disease occurrence m times in the next month given that it occurs n times in 1 year.\n|-\n| Geometric || It determines the number of independent trials needed to get the first successful outcome. Geometric distribution may be used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a certain decision in a business.\n|}\n\nPoisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.","For example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases.

In this case, the term \u2018residual\u2019 refers to the difference between observed and predicted data (Dheeraja V.2022).\n\nIf the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore. This does not mean that your results are biased, it only means that another approach can create a linear regression that more adequately models the actual trend in the data. In most cases, you can transform the data in a way that the OLS mechanics function again.\nTo find out if either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity is the case, we can look at the data with the help of different visualization approaches.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"sex\") ## creates a pairplot with a matrix of each variable on the y- and x-axis, but gender, which is colored in orange (hue= \"sex\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored of the final written exam, exercise and number of solved questions among males and females (gender group).","Looking a the graphs along the diagonal line, it shows a higher peak among the male students than the female students for the written exam, solved question (quanti) and exercise points (points).

The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were \"(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]\" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).\n\n'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2).","(5) Amer, M. Daim, T.U. Jetter, A. 2013. ''A review of scenario planning.''

Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nScenario Planning is the systematic development of descriptions of (typically multiple) plausible futures, which are then called \"scenarios\". These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them \"(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all \"fundamentally different\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios \"(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).\n\n'''There is no ''one'' procedure for Scenario Planning''' (5). A commonly cited approach by Schoemaker (2, 3) includes the following steps:<br>\n1) Definition of time frame, scope, decision variables and major actors of the issue in question."],"45":["'''One of the originators of Network Analysis was German philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel'''. His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued \"against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|'''Moreno's original work on Social Networks.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]\n\nRomanian-American psychosociologist '''Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s''' with his - and his collaborator Helen Jennings' - 'sociometry', which served \"(...) as a way of conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction.\" (Scott 1988, p.110). Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).","Moreno's and Jennings' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of ''''group dynamics', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.''' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.","Social Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.'''

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nThis entry aims to introduce Stacked Area Plot and its visualization using R\u2019s <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot2<\/syntaxhighlight> package. A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==","==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

This entry helps visualise two different types of stacked bar plots, ''Simple Stacked Plots'' and ''Proportions Stacked Plots'', and explains the difference between them. For more on the basics of barplots, please refer to the [[Barplots, Histograms and Boxplots]] entry.\n\n\n==Stacked Barplots: Proportions vs. Absolute Values==\nStacked bar plots show the quantitative relationship that exists between a main category and its subcategories. Each bar represents a principal category and it is divided into segments representing subcategories of a second categorical variable. The chart shows not only the quantitative relationship between the different subcategories with each other but also with the main category as a whole. They are also used to show how the composition of the subcategories changes over time.\n\nStacked bar plots should be used for Comparisons and Proportions but with emphasis on Composition. This composition analysis can be static for a certain moment in time, or dynamic for a determined period of time.\n\nStacked bar Plots are two-dimensional with two axes: one axis shows categories, the other axis shows numerical values. The axis where the categories are indicated does not have a scale (*) to highlight that it refers to discrete (mutually exclusive) groups. The axis with numerical values must have a scale with its corresponding measurements units.\n\n\n===When you should use a stacked bar plot===\nThe main objective of a standard bar chart is to compare numeric values between levels of a categorical variable. One bar is plotted for each level of the categorical variable, each bar\u2019s length indicating numeric value. A stacked bar chart also achieves this objective, but also targets a second goal."],"47":["== What the method does ==\nThought Experiments are the philosophical method that asks the \"What if\" questions in a systematic sense. Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word \"experiment\" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.","All this exemplifies that Thought Experiments are deeply normative, and show a great flexibility in terms of the methodological design setup in space and time. Some of the most famous Thought Experiments (such as the [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Teletransportation_paradox tele-transportation paradox]) are quite unconnected from our realities, yet still they are. This is the great freedom of Thought Experiments, as they help us to understand something basically about ourselves. '''Thought Experiments can be a deeply transformational methods, and can enable us to learn the most about ourselves, our choices, and our decisions.'''","The core strengths of Thought Experiments is to raise normative assumptions of about the world, and about the future. Thought Experiments can thus unleash a transformative potential within individuals, as people question the status quo in their norms and morals. Another strength of Thought Experiments is the possibility to consider different futures, as well as alternatives of the past. Thought Experiments are thus as versatile and flexible as people's actions or decision, and the ''What if'' of Thought Experiments allows us to re-design our world and make deep inquiries into alternative state of the world. This makes Thought Experiments potentially time-saving, and also resource-efficient. If we do not need to test our assumptions in the real world, our work may become more efficient, and we may even be able to test assumptions that would be unethical in the real world. '''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat experiment is purely theoretical, and thus not only important for physics, but also better for the cat.''' This latest strength is equally also the greatest weakness of Thought Experiments. We might consider all different option about alternative states of the world, yet we have to acknowledge that humankind has a long history of being wrong in terms of our assumptions about the world. In other words, while Thought Experiments are so fantastic because they can be unburdened by reality, this automatically means that they are also potentially different from reality. Another potential flaw of Thought Experiments is that they are only as good as our assumptions and reflections about the world. A four-year-old making up theThought Experiment \"What if I have an unlimited amount of ice cream?\" would consequently drown or freeze in the unlimited amount of ice cream. Four-year-olds are not aware of the danger of the \"unlimited\", and may not be the best Thought Experimenters. The same holds true for many other people, and just as our norms and values change, the value of specific Thought Experiments can change over time.
