This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A\/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A\/B tests, the scheme of [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|scientific experiments]] is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.\n\n==Planning Phase==\nDuring the planning phase, a goal and hypothesis are formulated, and a study design is developed that specifies the sample size, the duration of the study, and the metrics to be measured. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of the test.\n\n===Goal Definition===\nThe goal identifies problems or optimization potential to improve the software product. For example, in the case of a website, the goal could be to increase newsletter subscriptions or improve the conversion rate through changing parts of the website.\n\n===Hypotheses Formulation===\nTo determine if a particular change is better than the default version, a two-sample hypothesis test is conducted to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the two samples (version A and B). This involves stating the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n\nFrom the perspective of an A\/B test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the control and treatment group, while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the two groups which is influenced by a non-random cause.\n\nIn most cases, it is not known a priori whether the discrepancy in the results between A and B is in favor of A or B. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis should consider the possibility that both versions A and B have different levels of efficiency. In order to account for this, a two-sided test is typically preferred for the subsequent evaluation.\n\n'''For example:'''\n\n\"To fix the problem that there are hardly any subscriptions for my newsletter, I will put the sign-up box higher up on the website.\"\n\nGoal: Increase the newsletter subscriptions on the website.\n\nH0: There are no significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\nH1: There are significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.\n\n===Minimizing Confounding Variables===\nIn order to obtain accurate results, it is important to minimize confounding variables before the A\/B test is conducted. This involves determining an appropriate sample size, tracking the right users, collecting the right metrics, and ensuring that the randomization unit is adequate.\n\nThe sample size is determined by the percentage of users included in the test variants (control and treatment) and the duration of the experiment. As the experiment runs for a longer period of time, more visitors are exposed to the variants, resulting in an increase in the sample size. Because many external factors vary over time, it is important to randomize over time by running the control and treatment variants simultaneously at a fixed percentage throughout the experiment. Thereby the goal is to obtain adequate statistical power, where the statistical power of an experiment is the probability of detecting a particular effect if it exists. In practice, one can assign any percentages to the control and treatment, but 50% gives the experiment maximum statistical power.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to analyze only the subset of the population\/users that were potentially affected. For example, in an A\/B test aimed at optimizing newsletter subscriptions, it would be appropriate to exclude individuals who were already subscribed to the newsletter, as they would not have been affected by the changes made to the subscription form.\n\nAdditionally, the metrics used in the experiment should be carefully chosen based on their relevance to the hypotheses being tested. For example, in the case of an e-commerce site, metrics such as newsletter subscriptions and revenue per user may be of interest, as they are directly related to the goal of the test. However, it is important to avoid considering too many metrics at once, as this can increase the risk of miscorrelation.","'''In short:''' T-tests can be used to investigate whether there is a significant difference between two groups regarding a mean value (two-sample t-test) or the mean in one group compared to a fixed value (one-sample t-test). \n\nThis entry focuses on two-sample T-tests and covers the concept and purpose of the t-test, underlying assumptions, its implementation in R, as well as multiple variants for different conditions. For more information on the t-test and other comparable approaches, please refer to the entry on [[Simple Statistical Tests]].\n\n==General Information==\nLet us start by looking at the basic idea behind a two-tailed two-sample t-test. Conceptually speaking we have two hypotheses. \n\nH<sub>0<\/sub>: Means between the two samples do not differ significantly.<br\/>\nH<sub>1<\/sub>: Means between the two samples do differ significantly. <br\/>\n\nIn mathematical terms (\u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> and \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub> denote the mean values of the two samples): \n\nH<sub>0<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> = \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub> <br>\nH<sub>1<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> \u2260 \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub>. \n\n[[File:Kurt_olaf.jpg|500px|frameless|right]]\n'''Here is an example to illustrate this.''' The farmers Kurt and Olaf grow sunflowers and wonder who has the bigger ones. So they each measure a total of 100 flowers and put the values into a data frame.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Create a dataset\nset.seed(320)\n\nkurt <- rnorm(100, 60.5, 22)\nolaf <- rnorm(100, 63, 23)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nOur task is now to find out whether means values differ significantly between two groups.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# perform t-test\nt.test(kurt, olaf)\n\n\n##  Output:\n## \n##  Welch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  kurt and olaf\n## t = -1.5308, df = 192.27, p-value = 0.1275\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -11.97670   1.50973\n## sample estimates:\n## mean of x mean of y \n##  57.77072  63.00421\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nSo now, we performed a t-test and got a result. '''But how can we interpret the output?''' <br\/>\nThe criterion to consult is the p-value. This value represents the probability of the data given that H0 is actually true. Hence, a low p-value indicates that the data is very unlikely if H0 applies. Therefore, one might reject this hypothesis (in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1) if the p-value turns out to be below a certain threshold (\u03b1, usually set prior testing), which is often set to 0.05 and usually not larger than 0.1. <br\/>\n\nIn this case, the p-value is greater than 0.1. Therefore, the probability of H0 is considered to be \u201ctoo large\u201d to reject this hypothesis. Hence, we conclude that means do not differ significantly, even though we can say that descriptively the sample mean of Olaf\u2019s flowers is higher.\n<br\/>\nThere are multiple options to fine-tune the t-test if one already has a concrete hypothesis in mind concerning the direction and\/or magnitude of the difference. In the first case, one might apply a one-tailed t-test. The hypotheses pairs would change accordingly to either of these: <br>\n\nH<sub>0<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> \u2265 \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub><br>\nH<sub>1<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> < \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub>\n<br>\nor\n<br>\nH<sub>0<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> \u2264 \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub>\n<br>H<sub>1<\/sub>: \u03bc<sub>1<\/sub> > \u03bc<sub>2<\/sub>","Additionally, the metrics used in the experiment should be carefully chosen based on their relevance to the hypotheses being tested. For example, in the case of an e-commerce site, metrics such as newsletter subscriptions and revenue per user may be of interest, as they are directly related to the goal of the test. However, it is important to avoid considering too many metrics at once, as this can increase the risk of miscorrelation.\n\n==Execution Phase==\nThe execution phase involves implementing the study design, collecting data, and monitoring the study to ensure it is conducted according to the plan. During this phase, users are randomly assigned to the control or treatment group ensuring that the study is conducted in a controlled and unbiased manner.\n\n==Evaluation Phase==\nThe evaluation phase involves analyzing the data collected during the study and interpreting the results. This phase is crucial for determining the statistical significance of the results and drawing valid conclusions about whether there was a statistical significant difference between the treatment group and the control group. One commonly used method is calculating the [[Designing_studies#P-value|p-value]] of the statistical test, or by using [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes' theorem] calculating the probability that the treatment had a positive effect based on the observed data and the prior beliefs about the treatment.\n\nDepending on the type of data being collected different [[Simple Statistical Tests|statistical tests]] should be considered. For example, when dealing with discrete metrics such as click-through rate, the [https:\/\/mathworld.wolfram.com\/FishersExactTest.html Fisher exact test] can be used to calculate the exact p-value, while the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug chi-squared test] may be more appropriate for larger sample sizes.\n\nIn the case of continuous metrics, such as average revenue per user, the [[T-Test|t-test or Welch's t-test]] may be used to determine the significance of the treatment effect. However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https:\/\/data.library.virginia.edu\/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test\/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate.\n\n==Advantages and Limitations of A\/B Testing==\n'''Advantages'''\nA\/B testing has several advantages over traditional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a product or design. First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nKoning, Rembrand, Sharique Hasan, and Aaron Chatterji. \u201cExperimentation and Start-up Performance: Evidence from A\/B Testing.\u201d Management Science 68, no. 9 (September 2022): 6434\u201353. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1287\/mnsc.2021.4209Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nSiroker, Dan, and Pete Koomen.

Edited by Milan Maushart"],"1":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.\n\nIn addition, the ANOVA is equally limited as the regression, as both build on the [[Data_distribution#The_normal_distribution|normal distribution]]. Extensions of the ANOVA translated its analytical approach into the logic of [[Generalized Linear Models|generalised linear models]], enabling the implementation of other distributions as well. What unites all different approaches is the demand that the ANOVA has in terms of data, and with increasing complexity, the demands increase when it comes to the sample sizes. Within experimental settings, this can be quite demanding, which is why the ANOVA only allows to test very constructed settings of the world. All categories that are implemented as predictors in an ANOVA design represent a constructed worldview, which can be very robust, but is always a compromise. The ANOVA thus tries to approximate causality by creating more rigid designs. However, we have to acknowledge that experimental designs are always compromises, and more knowledge may become available later. Within clinical trials - most of which have an ANOVA design at their heart - great care is taken into account in terms of robustness and documentation, and clinical trial stages are built on increasing sample sizes to minimise the harm on humans in these experiments.\n\n'''Taken together, the ANOVA is one of the most relevant calculation tools to fuel the exponential growth that characterised the 20th century.''' Agricultural experiments and medical trials are widely built on the ANOVA, yet we also increasingly recognise the limitations of this statistical model. Around the millennium, new models emerged, such as [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. But at its core, the ANOVA is the basis of modern deductive statistical analysis.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nDesigning an ANOVA-based design demands experience, and knowledge of the previous literature. The deductive approach of an ANOVA is thus typically embedded into an incremental development in the literature. ANOVA-based designs are therefore more often than not part of the continuous development in normal science. However, especially since the millennium, other more advanced approaches gained momentum, such as mixed effect models, information theoretical approaches, and structural equation models. The rigid root of the normal distribution and the basis of p-values is increasingly recognised as rigid if not outright flawed, and model reduction in more complex ANOVA designs is far from coherent between different branches of sciences. Some areas of science reject p-driven statistics altogether, while other branches of science are still publishing full models without any model reduction whatsoever. In addition, the ANOVA is today also often used to analyse inductive datasets, which is technically ok, but can infer several problems from a statistical standpoint, as well as based on a critical perspective rooted in a coherent theory of science.","====Challenges of ANOVA experiments====\nThe ANOVA builds on a constructed world, where factor levels are like all variables constructs, which might be prone to errors or misconceptions. We should therefore realize that a non-significant result might also be related to the factor level construction. Yet a potential flaw can also range beyond implausible results, since ANOVAs do not necessarily create valid knowledge. If the underlying theory is imperfect, then we might confirm a hypothesis that is overall wrong. Hence the strong benefit of the ANOVA - the systematic testing of hypothesis - may equally be also its weakest point, as science develops, and previous hypothesis might have been imperfect if not wrong. \n\nFurthermore, many researchers use the ANOVA today in an inductive sense. With more and more data becoming available, even from completely undersigned sampling sources, the ANOVA becomes the analysis of choice if the difference between different factor levels is investigated for a continuous variable. Due to the [[Glossary|emergence]] of big data, these applications could be seen critical, since no real hypothesis are being tested. Instead, the statistician becomes a gold digger, searching the vastness of the available data for patterns, [[Causality#Correlation_is_not_Causality|may these be causal or not]]. While there are numerous benefits, this is also a source of problems. Non-designed datasets will for instance not be able to test for the impact a drug might have on a certain diseases. This is a problem, as systematic knowledge production is almost assumed within the ANOVA, but its application these days is far away from it.

Science contributed directly to the efficiency of production, for better or worse. Equally, the systematic experiments translated into other domains of science, such as psychology and medicine. \n\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe ANOVA is a deductive statistical method that allows to compare how a continuous variable differs under different treatments in a designed experiment. '''It is one of the most important statistical models, and allows for an analysis of data gathered from designed experiments.''' In an ANOVA-designed experiment, several categories are thus compared in terms of their mean value regarding a continuous variable. A classical example would be how a certain type of barley grows on different soil types, with the three soil types loamy, sandy and clay (Crawley 2007, p. 449). If the majority of the data from one soil type differs from the majority of the data from the other soil type, then these two types differ, which can be tested by a t-test. The ANOVA is in principle comparable to the t-test, but extends it: it can compare more than two groups, hence allowing to compare data in more complex, designed experiments.\n\n[[File:Yield.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Does the soil influence the yield? And how do I find out if there is any difference between clay, loam and sand? Maybe try an ANOVA...(graph based on Crawley 2007, p. 451)]]\n\nSingle factor analysis that are also called '[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nvAMVY2cmok one-way ANOVAs]' investigate one factor variable, and all other variables are kept constant. Depending on the number of factor levels these demand a so called [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latin_square randomisation], which is necessary to compensate for instance for microclimatic differences under lab conditions.\n\nDesigns with multiple factors or '[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/analysis-of-variance-anova-3026693 two way ANOVAs]' test for two or more factors, which then demands to test for interactions as well. This increases the necessary sample size on a multiplicatory scale, and the degrees of freedoms may dramatically increase depending on the number of factors levels and their interactions. An example of such an interaction effect might be an experiment where the effects of different watering levels and different amounts of fertiliser on plant growth are measured. While both increased water levels and higher amounts of fertiliser right increase plant growths slightly, the increase of of both factors jointly might lead to a dramatic increase of plant growth.\n\nThe data that is of relevance to ANOVAs can be ideally visualised in [[Introduction_to_statistical_figures#Boxplot|boxplots,]] which allows for an initial visualisation of the data distribution, since the classical ANOVA builds on the [[Regression Analysis|regression model]], and thus demands data that is [[Data_distribution#The_normal_distribution|normally distributed]]. '''If one box within a boxplot is higher or lower than the median of another factor level, then this is a good rule of thumb whether there is a significant difference.''' When making such a graphically informed assumption, we have to be however really careful if the data is normally distributed, as skewed distributions might tinker with this rule of thumb. The overarching guideline for the ANOVA are thus the p-values, which give significance regarding the difference between the different factor levels. \n\nIn addition, the original ANOVA builds on balanced designs, which means that all categories are represented by an equal sample size. Extensions have been developed later on in this regard, with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs."],"2":["* Even though the concept is intuitive to understand, the mathematical formulation and definitions can be intimidating for beginners.\n* Identifying correct prior distribution can be very difficult in real life problems which are not based on careful experimental design.\n* Solving complex models with Bayesian approach is still computationally expensive.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. Just like the examples presented above, this has several flipsides of the same coin.\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances. Especially for predictive modeling and small data problems, Bayesian approaches should be preferred, as well as for tough cases that defy the standard array of statistical distributions. Let us hope for a future where we surely know how to toss a coin. For more on this, please refer to the entry on [[Non-equilibrium dynamics]].\n\n== Outlook ==\nBayesian methods have been central in a variety of domains where outcomes are probabilistic in nature; fields such as engineering, medicine, finance, etc. heavily rely on Bayesian methods to make forecasts. Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Bayes, T. 1997.

Search terms: 'Bayesian' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n'''The basic principles behind Bayesian methods can be attributed to the probability theorist and philosopher, Thomas Bayes.''' His method was published posthumously by Richard Price in 1763. While at the time, the approach did not gain that much attention, it was also rediscovered and extended upon independently by Pierre Simon Laplace (1). Bayes' name only became associated with the method in the 1900s (3).\n\n'''The family of methods based on the concept of Bayesian analysis has risen the last 50 years''' alongside the increasing computing power and the availability of computers to more people, enabling the technical precondition for these calculation-intense approaches. Today, Bayesian methods are applied in a various and diverse parts of the scientific landscape, and are included in such diverse approaches as image processing, spam filtration, document classification, signal estimation, simulation, etc. (2, 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''Bayesian analysis relies on using probability figures as an expression of our beliefs about events.''' Consequently, assigning probability figures to represent our ignorance about events is perfectly valid in Bayesian approach. The probabilities, hence, depend on the current knowledge we have on the event that we are setting our belief on; the initial belief is known is \"prior\", and the probability figure assigned to the prior is called \"prior probability\". Initially, these probabilities are essentially subjective, as these priors are not the properties of a larger sample. However, the probability figure is updated as we receive more data. The final probabilities that we get after applying the Bayesian analysis, called \"posterior probability\", is based on our prior beliefs about the [[Glossary|hypothesis]], and the evidence that we collect:\n\n[[File:Bayesian Inference - Prior and posterior beliefs.png|450px|thumb|center|'''The probability distribution for prior, evidence, and posterior.''']]\n\nSo, how do we update the probability, and hence our belief about the event, as we receive new information? This is achieved using Bayes' Theorem.\n\n==== Bayes' Theorem ====\nBayes theorem provides a formal mechanism for updating our beliefs about an event based on new data. However, we need to establish some definitions before being able to understand and use Bayes' theorem.\n\n'''Conditional Probability''' is a probability based on some background information. If we consider two events A and B, conditional probability can be represented as:\n\n    P(A|B)\n\nThis representation can be read as the probability of event A occurring (or being observed) given that event B occurred (or B was observed). Note that in this representation, the order of A and B matters. Hence P(A|B) and P(B|A) are convey different information (discussed in the coin-toss example below).\n\n'''Joint Probability''', also called \"conjoint probability\", represents the probability of two events being true - i.e. two events occuring - at the same time. If we assume that the events A and B are independent, this can be represented as:\n\n    P(A\\ and\\ B)=P(B\\ and\\ A)= P(A)P(B)\n\nInterestingly, the conjoint probability can also be represented as follows:"],"3":["== The way forward ==\nIf we want to empirically investigate agency, we first and foremost investigate individuals, or actions of entities we consider as non-variable, or consequences of actions of individuals. All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.''' Because of this, much of our current knowledge of agency is either rooted in widely deductive experimental settings or the testing of very clear hypotheses, or questions of either logic or metaphysics, which are widely associated with philosophy. \n\nThe investigation of complex system has thrived in the last decades, both from an empirical as well as from a conceptual perspective. Many methods emerged or were subsequently adapted to answer questions as well as explore relations, and this thrive towards a deeper understanding of systems is at least one important difference to agency from a methodological standpoint. Much novel data is available, and often inductively explored. The scale of complex systems makes an intervention with a focus on [[Causality and correlation|causality]] a challenge, hence many investigated relations are purely correlative. Take for instance social media, or economic flows, which can be correlatively investigated, yet causality is an altogether different matter. This creates a methodological challenge, since many of our questions regarding human systems are normative, which is why many researchers assume causality in their investigations, or at least discuss relations as if these are causal. Another methodological problem related to causality are non-linear relations, since much of the statistical canon is based on probability and linear relations. While linear relations allow for a better inference of causal explanations, the long existing yet until recently hardly explored [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics are an example that we can inductively learn about systems at a growing pace without being dependent on linearity or normal-distributions. This Bayesian revolution is currently under way, but much of the disciplines relying on statistics did not catch up on this yet. Other methodological approaches will certainly be explored to gain insight into the nuts and bolts of complex systems, yet this is only slowly emerging. \n\nThe whole globe - although not a closed system \u2013 can be seen as a global system, and this is certainly worthwhile pursuing from a methodological standpoint. Still, global dynamics consist of such diverse data, that simply the translational act to bring different data together seems almost impossible right now. While emergence can lead to novel solutions, globalisation and technology have triggered uncountable events of emergence, such as global conflicts, climate change, increase in cancer rates and biodiversity loss. Humankind did certainly not plan these potential endpoints of ourselves, instead they emerged out of unpredictable combinations of our actions, and the data that can represent them. From a methodological standpoint, these events are just as unpredictable as is the effect which two molecules have onto each other and the environment. '''Emergence is a truly cross-scalar phenomenon.''' Consequently, many methodological accounts to countermeasure threats to human societies are correlative if they are empirical. We are far away from any deep understanding of emergence, and what makes phenomena emergent.\n[[File:Climate model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Climate models are increasingly getting more accurate, but the complexity and emergence of the global climate system may never be fully understood.'''

This third assumption of Hume is a direct consequence from 2). What unites factors, can be important, but equally important can be, what differentiates factors. This is often the reason why we think there is a causal link between two things, when there clearly is not. Imagine some evil person gives you decaf coffee, while you are used to caffeine. The effect might be severe, and it is clear that the caffeine in the coffee that wakes you up differentiates this coffee from the decaffeinated one.  \n \nTo summarize, causality is a mess in our brains. We are wrong about causality more often than we think, our brain is hardwired to find connections and often gets fooled into assuming causality. Equally, we often want to neglect causality, when it is clearly a fact. We are thus wrong quite often. In case of doubt, stick with [https:\/\/statisticsbyjim.com\/basics\/causation\/ Hume and the criteria] mentioned above. Relying on these when analysing correlations demand practice. The following examples may help you to this end:\n\n====Correlation is not Causality====\n[[File:Spurious correlations .png|center]]\n\nIf you'd like to see more [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g spurious correlations], click [http:\/\/www.tylervigen.com\/spurious-correlations here].\n\nA non-causal link is the information that in regions with more stork nests you have more babies. If you think that storks bring babies, this might seem logical. However, it is clearly untrue, storks do not bring the babies, and regions with more storks do not have more babies. \n\nWhile a '''correlation''' tests a mere relation between two variables, a '''regression''' implies a certain theory on why two variables are related. In times of big data there is a growing amount of correlations that are hard to explain. From a theory-driven perspective, this can even be a good thing. After all, many scientific inventions were nothing short of being accidents. Likewise, through machine learning and other approaches, many patterns are found these days where we have next to no explanation to begin with. Hence, new theories even evolve out of the crunching of a lot of data, where prediction is often more important than explanation. (For more on regressions, please refer to the entry on [[Regression Analysis]].)\n\nModern medicine is at the forefront of this trend, as medicine had a long tradition to have the cure in the focus of their efforts, instead of being able to explain all patterns. Modern genetics correlate specific gene sequences with potential diseases, which can be helpful, but also creates a burden or even harm. It is therefore very important to consider theory when thinking of causal relationships. \n\nMuch mischief has been done in the name of causality, while on the other hand the modern age of data made us free to be bound down by theory if we have a lot of data on our hands.

They can occur for a variety of reasons, such as data not being collected or recorded accurately, data being excluded because it was deemed irrelevant, or respondents being unable or unwilling to provide answers to certain questions (Tsikriktsis 2005, 54-55).\n\nIn this text, we will explore the different types of missing values and their distributions and discuss the implications for data analysis.\n\n==Types of missing values==\n\nThere are two main types of missing values: unit nonresponse and item nonresponse missing values. Item nonresponse occurs when an individual respondent is unable to provide an answer to a specific question on a survey or questionnaire (Schafer and Graham 2002, 149).\n\nUnit nonresponse occurs when an entire unit, such as a household or business, is unable to provide answers to a survey or questionnaire (ibid.).\n\nNext, we will look at how missing values can be distributed and what the implications of such distributions are. Generally, both types of missing values can occur in any distribution.\n\n==Distributions of missing values==\n\nThe distribution of missing values in a dataset can be either random or non-random. This can have a significant impact on the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data. Three common distributions of missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\n===Missing completely at random===\nMissing completely at random (MCAR) is a type of missing data where the missing values are not related to any other variables in the dataset, and they do not follow any particular pattern or trend. In other words, the missing values are completely random and do not contain any necessary information (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\nThe implications of MCAR for data analysis are relatively straightforward. Because the missing values are completely random, they do not introduce any bias into the analysis. Therefore, it is generally safe to impute the missing values using statistical methods, such as mean imputation or multiple imputations. However, even if the missing values are MCAR, there may still be other factors that can affect the analysis. It is important to consider the number and proportion of missing values (Scheffer 2002, 156). The larger the proportion of missing values in your overall dataset the less reliable is the use of the data. Imagine you had many unit nonresponse missing values across many different individuals, which results in having no variable without any missing value. This might affect the quality of your dataset. If and how this is the case, needs to be decided case by case.\n\n===Missing at random===\nMissing at random (MAR) is a type of missing data where the missing values are not related to the missing values themselves, but they might be to other variables in the dataset. In other words, the missing values are not completely random, but they are not systematically related to the true value of the missing values either (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55). For example, imagine you conduct a survey to analyze the relationship between education and income and there are missing values concerning income. If the missing values depend on education, then these missing values are missing at random. If they would depend on their actual income, they would not.\n\nThe implications of MAR for data analysis are more complex than those for MCAR. Because the missing values are not completely random, they may introduce bias into the analysis if they are not properly accounted for. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the underlying reasons for the missing data and take these into account when imputing the missing values. One common approach to dealing with MAR missing values is to use regression or other statistical methods to model the relationship between the missing values and the other variables in the dataset (Tsikriktsis 2005, 56). Once the relationship is clear, other methods can be used to approximate to correct the variables for the bias due to the missing values missing at random.\n\n===Missing not at random===\nMissing not at random (MNAR) is a type of missing data that is related to both the observed and unobserved data. This means that the missing data are not random and are instead influenced by some underlying factor. This can lead to biased results if the missing data are not properly accounted for in the analysis (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).","Learning statistics takes time, as it is mostly experience that allows us to be able to approach the statistical analysis of any given dataset.

Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page.\n\nIn addition, GLMs are often a part of very specific parts of science. Whether researchers implement GLMs or not is often depending on their education: it is not guaranteed that everybody is aware of their necessity and able to implement these advanced models. What makes this even more challenging is that within larger analyses, different parts of the dataset may be built upon different distributions, and it can be seen as inconvenient to report diverse GLMs that are based on different distributions, particularly because these are then utilising different evaluative criteria. The ideal world of a statistician may differ from the world of a researcher using these models, showcasing that GLMs cannot be taken for granted as of yet. Often, researchers still prioritise to follow disciplinary norms rather than go for comparability and coherence. Hence the main weakness of GLMs is a failure or flaw in the application of the model, which can be due to a lack of experience. This is especially concerning in GLMs, since such mistakes are more easily made than identified.","===== ANCOVA =====\n'''If you have at least one categorical predictor, you should do an ANCOVA'''.

This is done using multidimensional scaling (MDS), a multivariate statistical approach, which accomplishes the complex task of placing all data points in the relative distance to all other data points, as defined by the values of relatedness indicated in the matrix. \n\n[[File:Group Concept Mapping Point Map.png|500px|frameless|center|]]\n'''An exemplary Point Map of 95 statements from Trochim 1989, p.11.'''

This is done - as proposed by Trochim (1989) - by using the X-Y coordinates of each statement after the multidimensional scaling as input for a Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), which \"partitions the multidimensional scaling map into any number of clusters\" (Trochim 1989, 8). The analyst has to decide how many clusters the statements should be grouped into, based on what makes sense with regards to the topic and statements. You will find more on cluster analysis in [[Clustering Methods|this entry]].\n\nConcerning the software for the conduction of this clustering, Dare & Nowicki (2019, p.9) highlight that multidimensional scaling as well as hierarchical cluster analysis can be performed using statistical software such as R, SAS, or SPSS, or with the aforementioned groupwisdom\u00a9 software.\n\n[[File:Group Concept Mapping Cluster Map.png|400px|frameless|center|]]\n'''The Cluster Map, which puts the statements (data points) into groups by means of Cluster Analysis.'''

Two more maps can be created based on these. The ratings that were assigned to each statement in the matrix in Step 3 are placed in the respective position on the map, resulting in the \"Point Rating Map\". The same is done for each cluster, with the Point Ratings being averaged within each cluster.\n\n[[File:Group Concept Mapping Point Rating Map.png|400px|frameless|center|]]\n'''The respective Point Rating Map.'''

They also decide for either ''one-mode networks'', focusing on one type of node that could be connected with any other; or ''two-mode networks'' where there are two types of nodes, with each node unable to be connected with another node of the same type (Marin & Wellman 2010, 13). For a two-mode network, you could imagine an analysis of social events and the individuals that visit these, where each event is not connected to another event, but only to other individuals; and vice-versa.\n* '''Network boundaries:''' In a next step, the approach to defining nodes needs to be chosen. Three ways of defining networks can be named according to Marin & Wellman (2010, p.2, referring to Laumann et al. (1983)). These three are approaches not mutually exclusive and may be combined:\n** ''position-based approach'': considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally-defined positions to be network members, and all others would be excluded\n** ''event-based'' approach: those who had participated in key events are believed to define the population\n** ''relation-based approach'': begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.\n** Butts (2008) adds the ''exogenously defined boundaries'', which are pre-determined based on the research intent or theory which provide clearly specified entities of interest.\n* '''Type of ties:''' Then, the researcher needs to decide on which kinds of ties to focus. There can be two forms of ties between network nodes: ''directed'' ties, which go from one node to another, and ''undirected ties'', that connect two nodes without any distinct direction. Both types can either be [[Data formats|binary]] (they exist, or do not exist), or valued (they can be stronger or weaker than other ties): As an example, \"(..) a friendship network can be represented using binary ties that indicate if two people are friends, or using valued ties that assign higher or lower scores based on how close people feel to one another, or how often they interact.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14; Borgatti et al. 2009)\n* '''Data Collection''': When the research focus is chosen, the data necessary for Social Network Analysis can be gathered in [[Survey Research|Surveys]] or [[Interviews]], through [[Ethnography|Observation]], [[Content Analysis]] (typically literature-based) or similar forms of data gathering. Surveys and Interviews are most common, with the researchers asking individuals about the existence and strength of connections between themselves and others actors, or within other actors excluding themselves (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14). There are two common approaches when surveying individuals about their own connections to others: In a ''prompted recall'' approach, they are asked which people they would think of with regards to a specific topic (e.g. \"To whom would you go for advice at work?\") while they are shown a pre-determined list of potentially relevant individuals. In the ''free list'' approach, they are asked to recall individuals without seeing a list (Butts 2008, p.20f).\n* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape.","* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network.

Sometimes, nodes that are visually very close to each other are actually very far away. The actual distance between elements of the network should be measured based on the \"number of lines which it is necessary to traverse in order to get from one point to another.\" (Scott 1988, p.114)\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Network Types.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Different network structures.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.893]]\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Example.png|300px|thumb|center|'''An exemplary network structure.''' The dyads BE and BF - i.e. the connections between B and E, and B and F, respectively - are equally long in this network although BF appears to be shorter. This is due to the visual representation of the network, where B and F are closer to each other. Additionally, the central role of A becomes clear. Source: Scott 1988, p.114]]","== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.894]]\n\nThe Social Network Analyst then analyzes these relations \"(...) for structural patterns that emerge among these actors. Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3). Surrounding actors may provide leverage or influence that affect the agent's actions (Borgatti et al. 2009)"],"8":["'''In short:'''\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the \"noise\" caused by covariate variable that is not of experimental interest.

Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.\n\n== Assumptions ==\n'''Regression assumptions'''  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.\n'''ANOVA assumptions'''\n# Variances between groups are homogeneous.\n# Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.\n'''Specific ANCOVA assumptions'''\n# A further specific (but optional) assumption is homogeneity of slopes.

Search terms: 'ANOVA' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nWith a rise in knowledge during the [[History of Methods|Enlightenment]], it became apparent that the controlled setting of a [[Experiments|laboratory]] were not enough for experiments, as it became obvious that more knowledge was there to be discovered in the [[Field experiments|real world]]. First in astronomy, but then also in agriculture and other fields, the notion became apparent that our reproducible settings may sometimes be hard to achieve within real world settings. Observations can be unreliable, and errors in measurements in astronomy was a prevalent problem in the 18th and 19th century. Fisher equally recognised the mess - or variance - that nature forces onto a systematic experimenter (Rucci & Tweney 1980). The demand for more food due to the rise in population, and the availability of potent seed varieties and fertiliser - both made possible thanks to scientific experimentation - raised the question how to conduct experiments under field conditions. \n\nConsequently, building on the previous development of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#One_sample_t-test|t-test]], Fisher proposed the Analysis of Variance, abbreviated as ANOVA (Rucci & Tweney 1980). '''It allowed for the comparison of variables from experimental settings, comparing how a [[Data_formats#Continuous_data|continuous]] variable fared under different experimental settings.''' Doing experiments in the laboratory reached its limits, as plant growth experiments were hard to conduct in the small confined spaces of a laboratory. It also became questionable whether the results were actually applicable in the real world. Hence experiments literally shifted into fields, with a dramatic effect on their design, conduct and outcome. While laboratory conditions aimed to minimise variance - ideally conducting experiments with a high confidence -, the new field experiments increased sample size to tame the variability - or messiness - of factors that could not be controlled, such as subtle changes in the soil or microclimate. Fisher and his ANOVA became the forefront of a new development of scientifically designed experiments, which allowed for a systematic [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|testing of hypotheses]] under field conditions, taming variance through replicates. '''The power of repeated samples allowed to account for the variance under field conditions, and thus compare differences in [[Descriptive_statistics|mean]] values between different treatments.''' For instance, it became possible to compare different levels of fertiliser to optimise plant growth. \n\nEstablishing the field experiment became thus a step in the scientific development, but also in the industrial capabilities associated to it. Science contributed directly to the efficiency of production, for better or worse. Equally, the systematic experiments translated into other domains of science, such as psychology and medicine."],"9":["'''In short:'''\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the \"noise\" caused by covariate variable that is not of experimental interest.

This is done in order to see the true effect of the variable of interest on a dependent variable. Fundamental idea of ANCOVA is based on hypothesis testing, its goal is to evaluate multiple mutually exclusive theories about our [[Glossary|data]], where null hypothesis claims that the means of the groups are equal, and alternative [[Glossary|hypothesis]] rejects that based on p-value. Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.\n\n== Assumptions ==\n'''Regression assumptions'''  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.\n'''ANOVA assumptions'''\n# Variances between groups are homogeneous.\n# Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.\n'''Specific ANCOVA assumptions'''\n# A further specific (but optional) assumption is homogeneity of slopes. It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate. Since ANCOVA is hypothesis-based test, we need to have a understanding and well developed question about our data that we want an answer to, before we can generate a hypothesis and run the test.\n\n\n===Data preparation===\nIn order to demonstrate One-way ANCOVA test we will refer to balanced dataset \"anxiety\" taken from the \"datarium\" package. The data provides the anxiety score, measured at three time points, of three groups of individuals practicing physical exercises at different levels (grp1: basal, grp2: moderate and grp3: high).

For more information on the different variations, please refer to Schreier (2014) in the Key Publications.\n\n==== General Methodological Process ====\n* Any Content Analysis starts with the ''Design Phase'' in which the research questions are defined, the potential sources are gathered, and the analytical constructs are established that connect the prospective data to the general target of the analysis. These constructs can be based on existing theories or practices, the experience and knowledge of experts, or previous research (2).\n* Next, the ''Unitizing'' is done, i.e. the definition of analysis units. It may be distinguished between sampling units (= sources of data, e.g. newspaper articles, interviews) and analysis units (= units of data that are coded and analyzed, e.g. single words or broader messages), with different approaches to identifying both (see Krippendorff 2004).\n* Also, the ''sampling'' method is determined and the sample is drawn.\n* Then, the ''Coding Scheme'' - or 'Codebook' - is developed and the data are coded. 'Coding' generally describes the transfer of the available data into more abstract groups. A code is a label that represents a group of words that share a similar meaning (3). Codes may also be grouped into categories if they thematically belong together. There are two typical approaches to developing the coding scheme: a rather theory-driven and a rather data-driven approach. In a theory-driven approach, codes are developed based on theoretical constructs, research questions and elements such as an interview guide, which leads to a rather deductive coding procedure. In a data-driven approach, the coding system is developed as the researcher openly scans subsamples of the available material and develops codes based on these initial insights, which is a rather inductive process. Often, both approaches are combined, with an initial set of codes being derived from theory, and then iteratively adapted through a first analysis of the available material.\n* With the coding scheme at hand, the researcher reads (repeatedly) through the data material and assigns each analysis unit to one of the codes. The ''coding process'' may be conducted by humans, or - if sufficiently explicit coding instructions are possible - by a computer. In order to provide reliability, the codes should be intersubjective, i.e. every researcher should be able to code similarly, which is why the codes must be exhaustive in terms of the overarching construct, mutually exclusive, clearly defined, have unambiguous examples as well as exclusion criteria.\n* Last, the coded data are ''analyzed and interpreted'' whilst taking into account the theoretical constructs that underlie the research. Inferences are drawn, which - according to Mayring (2000) - may focus on the communicator, the message itself, the socio-cultural context of the message, or on the message's effect. The learnings may be validated in the face of other information sources, which is often difficult when Content Analysis is used in cases where there is no other possibility to access this knowledge. Finally, new hypotheses may also be formulated (all from 1, 2).\n\n[[File:Example Content Analysis (1).jpg|500px|thumb|right|'''An exemplary interview transcript from a person that was admitted to an emergency center.''' Source: Erlingsson & Brysiewicz 2017.]]\n\n[[File:Example Content Analysis (2).png|500px|thumb|right|'''The coding results for statements from the interview transcript above, grouped into one of several themes.''' Source: Erlingsson & Brysiewicz 2017.]]\n\nQualitative Content Analysis is a rather inductive process. The process is guided by the research questions - hypotheses may be tested, but this is not the main goal. As with much of qualitative research, this method attempts to understand the (subjective) meaning behind the analyzed data and to draw conclusions from there. Its purpose is to get hold of the 'bigger picture', including the communicative context surrounding the genesis of the data. The qualitative Content Analysis is a very iterative process. The coding scheme is often not determined prior to the coding process. Instead, its development is guided by the research questions and done in close contact to the data, e.g. by reading through all data first and identifying relevant themes. The codes are then re-defined iteratively as the researcher applies them to the data. As an example, the comparative analysis of two texts can be mentioned, where codes are developed based on the first text, re-iterated by reading through the second text, then jointly applied to the first text again. Also, new research questions may be added during the analysis if the first insights into the data raise them. This approach is closely related to the methodological concept of [[Grounded Theory]] approaches.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Narratives have their own inherent structure, formed by the narrating individual. Therefore, while narrative inquiry itself provides the benefits and challenges of a very open, reflexive and iterative research format, it is not non-structured, but gains structure by itself (see Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000)\n* Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) highlight that research methods that understand narratives as a mere format of data presented by the subject, which can then be analyzed just like other forms of content, neglect an important feature of narratives: Narrative Research \"(...) requires going beyond the use of narrative as rhetorical structure, to an analytic examination of the underlying insights and assumptions that the story illustrates\". Further, \"Narrative inquiry attempts to capture the 'whole story', whereas other methods tend to communicate understandings of studied subjects or phenomena at certain points, but frequently omit the important 'intervening' stages\" (ibid, p.3), with the latter being the context and cultural surrounding that is better understood when taking the whole narrative into account (see Moen 2006, p.59).\n* '''The insights gained through narratives are subjective to the narrator, which implies advantages and challenges.''' Compared to an 'objective' description of, e.g. a chain of events, the narration provides insights about the individual's interpretation and experience of the events, which may be inaccessible elsewhere, and shine light on complex social phenomena: \"Narrative is not an objective reconstruction of life - it is a rendition of how life is perceived.\" (Webster & Mertova 2007, p.3; see Moen 2006, p.62). However, this subjective representation of events or a situation may be distorted and differ from the 'real' world. Squire et al. (2014) refer to this distinction as different forms of 'truth' that researchers may be interested in: either representations of the physical world or of social realities which present the world through the lense of the narrator. Jovchelovitch & Bauer (2000, p.6) suggest that the researchers take both elements into consideration, first fully engaging with the subjective narrative, then comparing it to further information on the physical 'truth'. They should try \"(...) to render the narrative with utmost fidelity (in the first moment) and to organize additional information from different sources, to collate secondary material and to review literature or documentation about the event being investigated. Before we enter the field we need to be equipped with adequate materials to allow us to understand and make sense of the stories we gather.\" Moen (2006, p.63), by comparison, explains that \"(...) there is no static and everlasting truth\", anyway.\n* This [[Bias and Critical Thinking|conflict between different 'truths']] also has consequences for the quality criteria for Narrative Inquiry, especially for those research endeavors that create narratives themselves. To this end, 'usefulness' and 'persuasiveness' of the created narratives have been suggested as quality criteria (Barrett & Stauffer 2009) or, as Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) put it: \"Narrative research (...) does not strive to produce any conclusions of certainty, but aims for its findings to be 'well grounded' and 'supportable' (...) Narrative research does not claim to represent the exact 'truth', but rather aims for 'verisimilitude'\". (For more thoughts on validity in Narrative Inquiry, see Polkinghorne (2007)). For the analysis of narratives, a 'trustworthy' set of field notes and Interview data may serve as a measure of quality, which the researchers created through prolonged engagement in the field, triangulation of different data sources and the active search for disconfirmation of one's research results (see Moen 2006, p.64). Also, researchers \"(...) need to cogently argue that theirs is a viable interpretation grounded in the assembled texts\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.484).\n* Further challenges may arise during the active collaboration of the researcher in the field. For example, \"(...) the researcher and the research subjects interpret specific events in different ways or (...) the research subjects question the interpretive authority of the researcher\" (Moen 2006, p.62). Further comparable issues of qualitative field research are noted in the entry on [[Ethnography]].","== Strengths & Challenges ==\nQ methodology  is often criticised since the outcome depends on the way the research question is stated and on the way the Q items are chosen and\/ or formulated. Consequently, the researcher needs to pay a lot of attention towards these two aspects to get meaningful results (Watts and Stenner 2005). This can be done by doing pre-tests. Moreover, the interpretation of the results is rather subjective (Eden et al. 2005). Therefore, the validity and reproducibility of the Q methodology is often under debate. However, William Stephenson assures that the results of the repetitions of a Q method might not be identical, but still reveal relatively similar patterns (Stephenson 1972). Consequently the main conclusion of the repetitions of a Q methodology should be the same. \nDue to the qualitative nature of the Q methodology, it can only be used to identify points of view in a population, but not by how many people these points of view are shared. Therefore, it can only be used for exploratory purposes but not for hypothesis testing. \nAnother challenge regarding this method is that it does not include temporal dynamics, but portrays a temporally frozen image of viewpoints (Watts and Stenner 2005). Therefore, it is crucial to interpret the results of Q methodology in relation to the point in time when the data was collected. For instance, in the case of environmental questions and ecosystem services, it is known that perceptions of a population change with the seasons (Greenland-Smith & Sherren 2016; van Berkel & Verburg 2014). An ecosystem service such as outdoor recreation might be more important to people in summer than in winter. \nThe strength of the Q methodology lies in explorative studies in cases where there is not yet much data on a certain topic. In these cases, it creates a good overview of different perspectives. Moreover, it provides a large number of application opportunities as it can be used for various items such as statements, pictures and all kinds of objects. For the participants, it is more intuitive and fun to conduct a Q method-based interview than just answering questions or filling out a questionnaire. Since the implementation of the method is relatively straightforward compared to other methods, it is applicable to collect perceptions of all kinds of different stakeholders. \n\n\n== Normativity ==\nQ methodology is able to combine qualitative and quantitative aspects of knowledge, as it combines a statistical design with intuitive sorting of items such as pictures and statements. Therefore, this method has great potential for collecting data on stakeholders' perceptions on topics concerning the world's most disputed problems.\nHowever, the results are not representative for bigger populations as they are strongly dependent on the perspectives of the relatively few participants and their respective context. If the selection of participants is thus not representative, important perspectives could be unintentionally excluded and, as a result, overlooked (Danielson et al. 2009). The reason for the low number of participants is that in traditional Q studies, there used to be the rule that the number of participants should only be half the number of Q items. Otherwise, the authors feared to lose the qualitative aspects of this method (Watts & Stenner 2005). \nIn the future, the Q methodology might benefit from loosening this strict rule and allowing more participants to be included in the study. This would also allow more perspectives to be added and would therefore solve one of the main issues of this method. Additionally, more insightful statistical analyses would be possible with a larger number of participants, allowing not only a greater understanding of variance, but also a linkage of the outcome of the method with contextual data about the participants.\nThat a development of this method is possible and can be successful, is illustrated by the factor analysis which in traditional Q studies used the centroid method. This method provides a theoretically infinite number of rotated solutions. In the long run, this method proved to be too elaborate as the Q analyst has to consider a lot of different rotated solutions before they choose the most informative one. Instead, nowadays the PCA method is often used for factor analysis. This works much faster as the PCA automatically chooses the mathematically superior solution. The results of the PCA are described as \u201cequally satisfying\u201d as the results of the centroid method (Watts & Stenner 2005). \n\n== Outlook ==\nIn the future, Q methodology should be improved even further and adapted to the purposes it is nowadays used for. Since it is already used in interdisciplinary research, it makes sense to step away from the strict rules that it was associated with when it originated from qualitative psychology, where these rules were more of a conflict point instead of a solution\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n'''Theoretical'''"],"12":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Correlation Plots, including Scatter Plots, Line charts and Correlograms.

And always have in mind, '''correlations can tell you whether two variables are related, but cannot tell you anything about the causality between the variables!'''\n\nWith a bit experience, you can recognize quite fast, if there is a relationship between the variables. It is also possible to see, if the relationship is weak or strong and if there is a positive, negative or sometimes even no relationship. You can visualize correlation in many different ways, here we will have a look at the following visualizations:\n\n* Scatter Plot\n* Scatter Plot Matrix\n* Line chart\n* Correlogram\n\n\n'''A note on calculating the correlation coefficient:'''\nGenerally, there are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's rank coefficient. \n'''Pearson's correlation coefficient''' is the most popular among them. This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables.

In this example, the following parameters were defined:","==== Calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient r ====\nThe formula to calculate [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2B_UW-RweSE a Pearson correlation coefficient] is fairly simple. You just need to keep in mind that you have two variables or samples, called x and y, and their respective means (m). \n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-02 um 09.46.54.png|400px|center|thumb|This is the formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient r.]]\n<br\/>\n\n=== Conducting and reading correlations ===\nThere are some core questions related to the application and reading of correlations. These can be of interest whenever you have the correlation coefficient at hand - for example, in a statistical software - or when you see a correlation plot.<br\/>\n\n'''1) Is the relationship between two variables positive or negative?''' If one variable increases, and the other one increases, too, we have  a positive (\"+\") correlation. This is also true if both variables decrease. For instance, being taller leads to a significant increase in\u00a0[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3534609\/ body weight]. On the other hand, if one variable increases, and the other decreases, the correlation is negative (\"-\"): for example, the relationship between 'pizza eaten' and 'pizza left' is negative. The more pizza slices are eaten, the fewer slices are still there. This direction of the relationship tells you a lot about how two variables might be logically connected. The normative value of a positive or negative relation typically has strong implications, especially if both directions are theoretically possible. Therefore it is vital to be able to interpret the direction of a correlative relationship. \n\n'''2) Is the correlation coefficient small or large?''' It can range from -1 to +1, and is an important measure when we evaluate the strength of a statistical relationship. Data points may scatter widely in a [[Correlation_Plots#Scatter_Plot|scatter plot,]] or there may be a rather linear relationship - and everything in between. An example for a perfect positive correlation (with a correlation coefficient ''r'' of +1) is the relationship between temperature in [[To_Rule_And_To_Measure#Celsius_vs_Fahrenheit_vs_Kelvin|Celsius and Fahrenheit]]. This should not be surprising, since Fahrenheit is defined as 32 + 1.8\u00b0 C. Therefore, their relationship is perfectly linear, which results in such a strong correlation coefficient. We can thus say that 100% of the variation in temperature in Fahrenheit is explained by the temperature in Celsius.\n\nOn the other hand, you might encounter data of two variables that is scattered all the way in a scatter plot and you cannot find a significant relationship. The correlation coefficient ''r'' might be around 0.1, or 0.2. Here, you can assume that there is no strong relationship between these two variables, and that one variable does not explain the other one. \n\nThe stronger the correlation coefficient of a relation is, the more may these relations matter, some may argue. If the points are distributed like stars in the sky, then the relationship is probably not significant and interesting. Of course this is not entirely generalisable, but it is definitely true that a neutral relation only tells you, that the relation does not matter. At the same time, even weaker relations may give important initial insights into the data, and if two variables show any kind of relation, it is good to know the strength. By practising to quickly grasp the strength of a correlation, you become really fast in understanding relationships in data. Having this kind of skill is essential for anyone interested in approximating facts through quantitative data.  \n\n'''3) What does the relationship between two variables explain?''' \nThis is already an advanced skill, and is rather related to regression analysis. So if you have looked at the strength of a correlation, and its direction, you are good to go generally. But sometimes, these measures change in different parts of the data.","[[File:ConceptCorrelation.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Correlations]]]]\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Correlation analysis examines the statistical relationship between two continuous variables.

Search terms: 'Correlation' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\nKarl Pearson is considered to be the founding father of mathematical statistics; hence it is no surprise that one of the central methods in statistics - to test the relationship between two continuous variables - was invented by him at the brink of the 20th century (see Karl Pearson's \"Notes on regression and inheritance in the case of two parents\" from 1895). His contribution was based on work from Francis Galton and Auguste Bravais. With more data becoming available and the need for an \u201cexact science\u201d as part of the industrialization and the rise of modern science, the Pearson correlation paved the road to modern statistics at the beginning of the 20th century. While other approaches such as the t-test or the Analysis of Variance ([[ANOVA]]) by Pearson's arch-enemy Fisher demanded an experimental approach, the correlation simply required data with a continuous measurement level. Hence it appealed to the demand for an analysis that could be conducted based solely on measurements done in engineering, or on counting as in economics, without being preoccupied too deeply with the reasoning on why variables correlated. '''Pearson recognized the predictive power of his discovery, and the correlation analysis became one of the most abundantly used statistical approaches in diverse disciplines such as economics, ecology, psychology and social sciences.''' Later came the \u200bregression analysis, which implies a causal link between two continuous variables. This makes it different from a correlation, where two variables are related, but not necessarily causally linked. This article focuses on correlation analysis and only touches upon regressions. For more, please refer to the entry on [[Regression Analysis]].)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nCorrelation analysis examines the relationship between two [[Data formats|continuous variables]], and test whether the relation is statistically significant. For this, correlation analysis takes the sample size and the strength of the relation between the two variables into account. The so-called ''correlation coefficient'' indicates the strength of the relation, and ranges from -1 to 1. A coefficient close to 0 indicates a weak correlation. A coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, and a coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. \n\nCorrelations can be applied to all kinds of quantitative continuous data from all spatial and temporal scales, from diverse methodological origins including [[Survey]]s and Census data, ecological measurements, economical measurements, GIS and more. Correlations are also used in both inductive and deductive approaches. This versatility makes correlation analysis one of the most frequently used quantitative methods to date.\n\n'''There are different forms of correlation analysis.''' The Pearson correlation is usually applied to normally distributed data, or more precisely, data that shows a [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/students-t-distribution\/ Student's t-distribution]. Alternative correlation measures like [https:\/\/www.statisticssolutions.com\/kendalls-tau-and-spearmans-rank-correlation-coefficient\/ Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho] are usually applied to variables that are not normally distributed. I recommend you just look them up, and keep as a rule of thumb that Spearman's rho is the most robust correlation measure when it comes to non-normally distributed data."],"13":["=== R Code ===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nlibrary(corrplot)\ncorrelations <- cor(mtcars)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nClear and meaningful coding and plots are important.

This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables.

There is no such thing as a normal weight, but studies from indigenous communities show a normal distribution in the weight found in their populations. Within our wider world, this is clearly different. Yet before we bash the Western diet, please remember that never before in the history of humans did we have a more steady stream of calories, which is not all bad.\n\n'''Distributions can have different [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XSSRrVMOqlQ skews].''' There is the symmetrical skew which is basically a normal distributions or bell curve that you can see on the picture. But normal distributions can also be skewed to the left or to the right depending on how mode, median and mean differ. For the symmetrical normal distribution they are of course all the same but for the right skewed distribution (mode < median < mean) it's different.\n\n\n==== Detecting the normal distribution ====\n[[File:Car Accidents Barplot 2.jpg|thumb|400px|left|'''This is a time series visualized through barplots.''']]\n[[File:Car Accidents Histogram 2.jpg|thumb|400px|left|'''This is the same data as a histogram.''']]\n[[File:Car Accidents Boxplot 2.jpg|thumb|400px|left|'''And this the data as a boxplot.'''

And how can you recognize it when you have a [[Barplots, Histograms and Boxplots|boxplot]] in front of you? Or a histogram? The best way to learn it, is to look at it. Always remember the ideal picture of the bell curve (you can see it above), especially if you look at histograms. If the histogram of your data show a long tail to either side, or has multiple peaks, your data is not normally distributed. The same is the case if your boxplot's whiskers are largely uneven.\n\nYou can also use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normal distribution. If the test returns insignificant results (p-value > 0.05), we can assume normal distribution.\n\nThis barplot (at the left) represents the number of front-seat passengers that were killed or seriously injured annually from 1969 to 1985 in the UK. And here comes the magic trick: If you sort the annually number of people from the lowest to the highest (and slightly lower the resolution), a normal distribution evolves (histogram at the left).\n\n'''If you would like to know how one can create the diagrams which you see here, this is the R code:'''\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n\n# If you want some general information about the \"Seatbelt\" dataset, at which we will have look, you can use the ?-function.\n# As \"Seatbelts\" is a dataset in R, you can receive a lot of information here.

Quite many, I guess.''' How many drink 3-4 cups? Fewer people, I would say. Now how many drink 10 cups? Only a few, I hope. A similar and maybe more healthy example could be found in sports activities. How many people make 30 minute of sport per day? Quite many, maybe. But how many make 5 hours? Only some very few. In phenomenon that can be counted, such as sports activities in minutes per day, most people will tend to a lower amount of minutes, and few to a high amount of minutes. \n\nNow here comes the funny surprise. Transform the data following a [https:\/\/towardsdatascience.com\/the-poisson-distribution-and-poisson-process-explained-4e2cb17d459 Poisson distribution], and it will typically follow the normal distribution if you use the decadic logarithm (log).

Residuals should be distributed like stars in the sky. If they are not, then your error is not normally distributed, which basically indicates that you are missing some important information. \n\nThe third and last problem you can bump into with your residuals are gaps. Quite often you have sections in your data about which you know nothing about, as you have no data for this section. An example would be if you have a lot of height measurement of people between 140-180 cm in height, and one person that is 195 cm tall. About the section between 180-195cm we know nothing, there is a gap.\n \nSuch flaws within residuals are called errors. These errors are the reason why all models are wrong. If a model would be perfect, then there would be probably a mistake, at least when considering models in statistics. Learning to read statistical models and their respective residuals is the daily bread and butter of statistical modelling. The ability to see flaws in residuals as well as the ability to just see a correlation plot in consider the strength of the relation, if any exists, is an important skill in data mining. Learning about models means to also learn about the flaws of models.\n\n==Is the world linear?==\n[[File:IslandTheory.png|thumb|right|This graph shows you the linear relationship between island size and number of species.

Regime shifts, disasters and crisis are thought to be prominent examples. I would argue, that even these shifts follow linear patterns, though on a smaller temporal scale. Take the last financial crisis. A lot was building up towards this crisis, yet the collapse that happened in one day followed a linear pattern, if only a strongly exponential one. Many supposably non-linear shifts are indeed linear, they just happen very quickly.\n[[File:IslandTheoryBook.jpg|thumb|left|The book The Theory of Island Biogeography by MacArthur and Wilson tells you a lot about the relationship between island size and number of species.]]\nLinear patterns describe something like a natural law.

It would be possible to put the oven on 100 \u00b0C and the veggies would cook much slower than at 150 \u00b0C.

The distribution describes how the means of small samples of a normal distribution are distributed around the distributions true mean. The locations ''x'' of the means of samples with size n and ''\u03bd = n\u22121'' degrees of freedom are distributed according to the following probability distribution function:\n[[File:prbdistribution.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nThe gamma function:\n[[File:prbdistribution1.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nFor integer values:\n[[File:prbdistribution2.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nThe t-distribution is symmetric and approximates the normal distribution for large sample sizes.\n\n==t-test==\nTo compare the mean of a distribution with another distributions mean or an arbitrary value \u03bc, a t-test can be used. Depending on the kind of t-test to be conducted, a different t-statistic has to be used. The t-statistic is a random variable which is distributed according to the t-distribution, from which rejection intervals can be constructed, to be used for hypothesis testing.\n[[File:prbdst3.png|450px|thumb|center|Fig.1: The probability density function of the t-distribution for 9 degrees of freedom. In blue, the 5%, two-tailed rejection region is marked.]]\n\n==One-sample t-test==\nWhen trying to determine whether the mean of a sample of ''n'' data points with values ''x<sub>i<\/sub>'' deviates significantly from a specified value ''\u03bc'', a one-sample t-test can be used. For a sample drawn from a standard normal distribution with mean ''\u03bc'', the t-statistic t can be constructed as a random variable in the following way:\n[[File:prbdst4.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nThe numerator of this fraction is given as the difference between \u2002''x'', the measured mean of the sample,\nand the theorized mean value ''\u03bc.''\n[[File:prbdst5.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nThe denominator is calculated as the fraction of the samples standard deviation ''\u03c3'' and the square-root of the samples size ''n''. The samples standard deviation is calculated as follows:\n[[File:prbdst6.png|700px|frameless|center]]\nThe t statistic is distributed according to a students t distribution. This can be used to construct confidence intervals for one or two-tailed hypothesis tests.","#Now we can for example test, if the difference in sepal length between setosa and virginica is significant:\n#H0 hypothesis: The medians (distributions) of setosa and virginica are equal\n#H1 hypothesis: The medians (distributions) of setosa and virginica differ\n\n#test for normality\nshapiro.test(setosa$Sepal.Length)\nshapiro.test(virginica$Sepal.Length)\n#both are normally distributed\n\n#wilcoxon sum of ranks test\nwilcox.test(setosa$Sepal.Length,virginica$Sepal.Length)\n\n#the p-value is 2.2e-16, which is below 0.05 (it's almost 0). \n#Therefore we neglect the H0 Hypothesis and adopt the H1 Hypothesis.\n#Based on this result we may conclude the medians of these two distributions differ. \n#The alternative hypothesis is stated as the \u201ctrue location shift is not equal to 0\u201d. \n#That\u2019s another way of saying \u201cthe distribution of one population is shifted to the left or \n#right of the other,\u201d which implies different medians. \n\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\n\n====f-test====\n'''The f-test allows you to compare the ''variance'' of two samples.''' Variance is calculated by taking the average of squared deviations from the mean and tells you the degree of spread in your data set. The more spread the data, the larger the variance is in relation to the mean. If the p-value of the f-test is lower than 0,05, the variances differ significantly. Important: for the f-Test, the data of the samples has to be normally distributed. \n\n'''Example''': If you examine players in a basketball and a hockey team, you would expect their heights to be different on average. But maybe the variance is not. Consider Figure 1 where the mean is different, but the variance the same - this could be the case for your hockey and basketball team. In contrast, the height could be distributed as shown in Figure 2. The f-test then would probably yield a p-value below 0,05.\n\n[[File:Normal distribution.jpg|400px|thumb|left|Figure 1 shows '''two datasets which are normally distributed, but shifted.'''

The researchers calculated many more measures and a comparison to a non-Delphi forecasting round, which you can read more about in the publication.

Instead, the process must be adapted to the research design and underlying problem (4).\n* The proper selection of participating experts constitutes a major challenge for Delphi processes (3, 4, 5, 6). In addition, the researchers should be aware that any expert is likely to forecast based on their specific sub-system perspective and might neglect other factors (4).\n* The monitor (= researcher) must not impose their own preconceptions upon the respondents when developing the questionnaire but be open for contributions from the participants. The questions should be concise and understandable and should not incentivise the participant to \"get the job over with\" (Linstone & Turoff 1975, p.568; 5).\n* Diverse forms of [[Glossary|bias]] might occur on the part of the participants that need to be anticipated by the researcher. These include discount of the future, over-optimism \/ over-pessimism, misinterpretations with regard to the complexity and uncertainty involved in forecasting the future as well as other forms of bias that may be imposed through the feedback process (4, 6).\n* The responses must be adequately summarized, analyzed and presented to the participants (see the variety of measures for 'consensus' in What the method does)). \"Agreement about a recommendation, future event, or potential decision does not disclose whether the individuals agreeing did so for the same underlying reasons. Failure to pursue these reasons can lead to dangerously false results.\" (Linstone & Turoff 1975, p.568).\n* Disagreements between participants should be explored instead of being ignored so that the final consensus is not artificial (4).\n* The participants should be recompensated for their demanding task (4)\n\n\n== Normativity ==\n==== Connectedness \/ nestedness ====\n* While Delphi is a common forecasting method, backcasting methods (such as [[Visioning & Backcasting|Visioning]]) or [[Scenario Planning]] may also be applied in order to evaluate potential future scenarios without tapping into some of the issues associated with forecasting (see more in the [[Visioning|Visioning]] entry)\n* Delphi, and the conceptual insights gathered during the process, can be a starting point for subsequent research processes.\n* Delphi can be combined with qualitative or quantitative methods beforehand (to gain deeper insights into the problem to be discussed) and afterwards (to gather further data).\n\n==== Everything normative related to this method ====\n* The Delphi method is highly normative because it revolves around the subjective opinions of stakeholders.\n* The selection of the participating experts is a normative endeavour and must be done carefully so as to ensure a variety of perspectives.\n* Delphi is an instrument of [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] research that may be used both to find potential policy options as well as to further academic proceedings. Normativity is deeply rooted in this connection between academia and the 'real-world'.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\n==== Open questions ====\n* The diverse fields in which the Delphi method was applied has diversified and thus potentially confounded its methodological homogeneity, raising the need for a more comparable application and reporting of the method (6, 7)\n\n\n== An exemplary study ==\n[[File:Delphi - Exemplary study Kauko & Palmroos 2014 title.png|600px|frameless|center|The title of the exemplary study for Delphi method.

The participants were provided with information on the past developments of each of these variables.","[[File:ConceptDelphi.png|450px|left|frameless|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization for Delphi]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Present|Present]] || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n'''In short:''' The Delphi Method is an interactive form of data gathering in which expert opinions are summarized and consensus is facilitated.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Delphi method originates from work at RAND Corporation, a US think-tank that advises the US military, in the late 1940s and 1950s (2, 3, 5). RAND developed \"Project Delphi\" as a mean of obtaining \"(...) the most reliable consensus of opinion of a group of experts.\" (Dalkey & Helmer 1963, p.1). At the time, the alternative - extensive gathering and analysis of quantitative data as a basis for forecasting and deliberating on future issues - was not technologically feasible (4, 5). Instead, experts were invited and asked for their opinions - and Delphi was born (see (1)).\n\n[[File:Delphi Method SCOPUS.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits for the Delphi method until 2019.''' Search terms: 'Delphi Panel', 'Delphi Method', 'Delphi Methodology', 'Delphi Study', 'Delphi Survey' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\nIn 1964, a RAND report from Gordon & Helmer brought the method to attention for a wider audience outside the military defense field (4, 5). Subsequently, Delphi became a prominent method in technological forecasting; it was also adapted in management; in fields such as drug policy, education, urban planning; and applied in order to understand economic and social phenomena (2, 4, 5). An important field today is the healthcare sector (7). While during the first decade of its use the Delphi method was mostly about forecasting future scenarios, a second form was developed later that focused on concept & [[Glossary|framework]] development (3).\n\nDelphi was first applied in these non-scientific fields before it reached academia (4). Here, it can be a beneficial method to identify topics, questions, terminologies, constructs or theoretical perspectives for research endeavours (3).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe Delphi method is \"(...) a systematic and interactive research technique for obtaining the judgment of a panel of independent experts on a specific topics\" (Hallowell & Gambatese 2010, p.99). It is used \"(...) to obtain, exchange, and develop informed opinion on a particular topic\" and shall provide \"(...) a constructive forum in which consensus may occur\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309). Put simply, experts on a topic are gathered and asked in a systematic process what they think about the future, until consensus is found. \n\n==== The Delphi procedure ====\n[[File:ResultVisualisationDelphi.png|400px|thumb|right|Questionnaire results for the original RAND study, asking for an estimate of bomb requirements.

A group of experts \/ stakeholders on a specific issue is identified and invited as participants for the Delphi. These participants represent different backgrounds: academics, government and non-government officials as wel, as practitioners. They should have a diverse set of perspectives and profound knowledge on the discussed issues. They may be grouped based on their organizations, skills, disciplines or qualifications (3). Their number typically ranges from 10 up to 30, depending on the complexity of the issue (2, 3, 5, 6)."],"18":["The interconnectedness of different forms of knowledge; reflexivity of researchers and other actors; the recognition of [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity]] in systems; and the necessity of power relations in knowledge production are prominent examples of current challenges that methodologies as of yet have not solved. We are probably still far away from the creation of a solidified canon of knowledge to solve these riddles. One could argue that we will never solve these methodological problems altogether, but that the joined action and interaction while working on these problems will be the actual solution, and that a real solution as with past methods of normal science shall never be reached. This is unclear to date, yet we need to become aware that when we question the ''status quo'' of knowledge production and methodologies, we may not be looking for goals, but more for a path. There are several examples in sustainability science that follow this path, such as [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinarity]] and [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|system thinking]]. However, according to critical realism, it may be good to solidify innovative and novel methodologies to a point that enables as to take meaningful actions based on the knowledge we create.\n----\n[[Category:Normativity_of_Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","''Phase C''\n* Realize two-dimensional integration.\n* Generate products for both parties (societal and scientific).\n\n''General principles''\n* Facilitate continuous evaluation\n* Mitigate conflict constellations\n* Enhance capabilities for and interest in participation\n<br>\n\n==== Challenges ====\nThere is a wide range of potential pitfalls challenging the achieval of the ideal-typical model.\n\n* Mauser et al. (2013) remark that the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved need to be clarified from the beginning and existent inequalities need to be removed. Further, they comment that integrated research modes demand new methods and concepts, new institutional arrangements, organizational [[Glossary|competencies]] and tailored funding possibilities. The cooperation between science and society requires reflexive learning processes, appropriate communication tools and also needs to reflect on the role of science in the overall endeavour. Also, the authors highlight that there may be inertia to change in the given system which needs to be overcome.\n* Lang et al. (2012) name various issues in the framing of problems (lack of problem awareness, unbalanced problem ownership), processual issues (insufficient legitimacy of the actors involved, conflicting methodological standards, lack of integration (knowledge, structures, [[Glossary|communication)]], discontinuous [[Glossary|participation]]), as well as challenges concerning the development of solutions (ambiguity of results, fear to fail, limited solution options, lack of legitimacy of transdisciplinary outcomes, capitalization on distorted research results, issues when tracking impacts). Also, \"[a]rguing from a more conventional research perspective, scientists might be skeptical with respect to reliability, validity, and other epistemological and methodological aspects of collaborative research (\u2018\u2018credibility\u2019\u2019). Practitioners and stakeholders, on the other hand, might be skeptical regarding the practical relevance of the results (\u2018\u2018salience\u2019\u2019).\" (Lang et al. 2012)\n* Hall & Rourke (2014) expand on communicative challenges, claiming that \"[n]ot all of the challenges that threaten TDSS [transdisciplinary sustainability science] are communication challenges, but communication breakdown can exacerbate any of them. Because of its centrality, care must be taken by collaborators to cultivate a healthy communication dynamic; however, given the many perspectives involved in a typical TDSS project, this will not be easy. These projects meet complex problems with complex responses, entailing the need to remain flexible and responsive to participant requirements and the need to modify the approach if new information and values arise.\" They highlight communicative challenges especially in the framing of problems (exclusion of important perspectives, different views of the problem) and the conduction of the research (unwillingness to share personal perspectives, failure to recognize or articulate differences in individual assumptions, uncertainties and incomplete or incompatible knowledge, limited cognitive abilities to integrated individual partial knowledge).\n\n==== Methods of transdisciplinary research ====\nSeveral scientific methods are useful for transdisciplinary work. Many methods used in TD research represent single elements of a broader transdisciplinary inquiry, such as [[Interviews]] which may be used in a first step of [[Glossary|consultation]]. Other methods, however, originate from transdisciplinary endeavours or are strongly associated to them. Among these, noteworthy methods include:\n\n* [[Visioning & Backcasting|Visioning]] as well as [[Scenario Planning]], which strongly favor transdisciplinary research.\n* [[Living Labs & Real World Laboratories|Living Labs & Real-World Laboratories]] as research environments that facilitate transdisciplinary research.\n* Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) can be used to evaluate scenarios.\n* [[Citizen Science]] can also be transdisciplinary.\n\n==== Skills & Tools ====\nVarious Skills & Tools may facilitate transdisciplinary research and help solve some of the challenges mentioned above. Among these are:\n\n* [[Design Thinking]]\n* [[Disney Method]]\n* [[Lego Serious Play]]\n* [[Stakeholder Mapping]]\n* [[World Caf\u00e9]]\n* [[The Art of Hosting | Workshops]]\n\n==== Agency ====\nThe choice of methods for TD research is also relevant for the level of [[Glossary|agency]] and participation that is provided to the non-scientific stakeholders in the process. One may differentiate four levels of [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|agency]] on which societal actors are involved in scientific research (see also Brandt et al. 2013):","To this end, multi- and interdisciplinary research modes (see above) are research modes that already cross disciplinary boundaries to some extent, sharing knowledge or jointly creating it, but transdisciplinary research best represents this new form of knowledge production. Mode 2 research and transdisciplinary research have therefore often been used synonymously. Transdisciplinary research facilitates the creation of not only system knowledge (the current state) and target knowledge (the intended state), but especially of transformational knowledge (how to get there) that considers the demands and preconditions of all relevant stakeholders. Thus, transdisciplinary research is of particular interest where there is a lack of practical knowledge about a specific problem, solution pathways are not yet known and there is a need for societal negotiation throughout the development of solutions. (Arnold & Piontek, p.145f)\n\n'''Transdisciplinary research is of special importance to Sustainability Science and has received immense recognition in this field in the last years.''' This is because \"[s]ustainability is also inherently transdisciplinary\" (Stock & Burton 2011, p.1091), as it builds on the premise of solving real-world problems which are deeply nestled in ecological, political, economic and social processes and structures and therefore cannot be understood and solved without engaging with these spheres (Kates et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary research is a suitable approach for Sustainability Science: it allows to incorporate the knowledge of relevant stakeholders; it considers the normative dimensions involved in societal endeavors (that is, diverging norms, goals and visions of different societal spheres); and it increases [[Glossary|legitimacy]], ownership and accountability for the jointly developed solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Stock & Burton 2011). The integrative transdisciplinary approach highlights systemic interdependencies, enables a better understanding of complex issues and provides better knowledge to develop socially robust and applicable, effective solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2015).\n\n\n== How to do TD in Sustainability Science ==\nHere, we will refer to the ideal-typical model presented by Lang et al (2012). It introduces a conceptual guide, structured into three phases, on how transdisciplinary research for sustainability science should ideally be conducted. The relevant steps of each phase as well as general principles for the whole process will be listed below. The presented process is recursive: Problems emerging in scientific as well as societal practice are integrated in the transdisciplinary research approach. After its three phases have been realized, the newly generated knowledge and solutions are re-integrated into these two spheres, where they are applied and consolidated. Ultimately, new challenges emerge that demand renewed transdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n==== The ideal-typical model ====\n[[File:TDmodel.png|500px|thumb|left|'''The ideal-typical model for TD research in Sustainability Science.'''

The explanatory characteristic allowed by Critical Realism might be good enough for the pragmatist, the practical may speak to the modern engagement of science with and for society, and the normative is aware of \u2013 well - all things normative, including the critical. Hence a door was opened to a new mode of science, focussing on the situation and locatedness of research within the world. This was surely a head start with Kant, who opened the globe to the world of methods. There is however a critical link in Habermas, who highlighted the duality of the rational individual on a small scale and the role of global societies as part of the economy (Habermas 1987). This underlines a crucial link to the original three foundational theories in philosophy, albeit in a dramatic and focused interpretation of modernity. Habermas himself was well aware of the tensions between these two approaches \u2013 the critical and the empirical -, yet we owe it to Critical Theory and its continuations that a practical and reflexive knowledge production can be conducted within deeply normative systems such as modern democracies. \n\nLinking to the historical development of methods, we can thus clearly claim that Critical Theory (and Critical Realism) opened a new domain or mode of thinking, and its impact can be widely felt way beyond the social science and philosophy that it affected directly. However, coming back to bias, the answer to an almost universal rejection of empiricism will [[Big problems for later|not be followed here]]. Instead, we need to come back to the three foundational theories of philosophy, and need to acknowledge that reason, social contract and utilitarianism are the foundation of the first empirical disciplines that are at their core normative (e.g. psychology, social and political science, and economics). Since bias can be partly related to these three theories, and consequentially to specific empirical disciplines, we need to recognise that there is an overarching methodological bias. This methodological bias has a signature rooted in specific design criteria, which are in turn related to specific disciplines. Consequently, this methodological bias is a disciplinary bias - even more so, since methods may be shared among scientific disciplines, but most disciplines claim either priority or superiority when it comes to the ownership of a method.\n\nThe disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","The course '''Scientific methods - Different paths to knowledge''' introduces the learner to the fundamentals of scientific work. It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances.\n\n'''Inductive vs. deductive'''\nSome branches of science try to verify or falsify hypotheses, while other branches of science are open towards the knowledge being created primarily from the data. Hence the difference between a method that derives [[Glossary|theory]] from data, or one that tests a theory with data, is often exclusive to specific branches of science. To this end, out of the larger availability of data and the already existing knowledge we built on so far, there is a third way called abductive reasoning. This approach links the strengths of both [[Glossary|induction]] and [[Glossary|deduction]] and is certainly much closer to the way how much of modern research is actually conducted. \n\n'''Scales'''\nCertain scientific methods can transcend spatial and temporal scales, while others are rather exclusive to a specific partial or temporal scale. While again this does not make one method better than another, it is certainly relevant since certain disciplines almost focus exclusively on specific parts of scales. For instance, psychology or population ecology are mostly preoccupied with the individual, while macro-economics widely work on a global scale. Regarding time there is an ever increasing wealth of past information, and a growing interest in knowledge about the future. This presents a shift from a time when most research focused on the presence. \n\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods]]\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Critical Theory & Bias ===\n'''Critical theory'''\nThe rise of empiricism and many other developments of society created critical theory, which questioned the scientific [[Glossary|paradigm]], the governance of systems as well as democracy, and ultimately the norms and truths not only of society, but more importantly of science. This paved the road to a new form of scientific practice, which can be deeply normative, and ultimately even transformative.  \n\n'''The pragmatism of [[Glossary|bias]]'''\nCritical theory raised the alarm to question empirical inquiry, leading to an emerging recognition of bias across many different branches of science. With a bias being, broadly speaking, a tendency for or against a specific construct (cultural group, social group etc.), various different forms of bias may flaw our recognition, analysis or interpretation, and many forms of bias are often deeply contextual, highlighting the presence or dominance of constructed groups or knowledge.","===Establish postdisciplinary freedom===\nScientific disciplines are a testimony of the oppressive evolving of science out of the [[History of Methods|Enlightenment]], leading to silos of knowledge that we call scientific discipline. '''While it is clear that this minimises the chances of a more holistic knowledge production, scientific disciplines are still necessary from a perspective of depth of knowledge.''' Medicine is a good example where most researchers are highly specialised, because there is hardly any other way to contribute to the continuous evolution of knowledge. We may thus conclude that focus in itself is necessary, and often helpful. There are however also other factors about the existence of scientific disciplines that are important to raise. First of all, scientific disciplines are in a fight about priorities of knowledge and interpretation. Many disciplines claim that their knowledge is indeed of a higher value than the knowledge of the other discipline. It is clear that this notion needs to be rejected once we take a step back and look at the whole picture, since such claims of superiority do not make any sense. Yet from a perspective of [[Bias and Critical Thinking|critical realism]], one could claim that ethics and maybe even philosophy are on a different level, because the can transcend epistemological perspective, and may even create ontological truths. While other disciplines thus vanish in the future, philosophy, and more importantly [[Ethics and Statistics|ethics]], are about our responsibility as researchers, and may thus play a pivotal role. I would propose that statistics could contribute to this end, because statistics is at its heart not disciplinary. Instead, statistics could provide a reflexive link between different domains of knowledge, despite it being almost in an opposite position today, since statistics is often the methodological dogma of many scientific disciplines.\n\n===Clarify the role of theory===\nStatistics today is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Statistics can help to test hypotheses, leading to a accepting or rejection of our questions that are rooted in our theories, making [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] research often rigid and incremental. At the extreme opposite end, there is the [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] line of thinking, which claims an open mind independent of theory, yet often still looks at the world through the lens of a theoretical foundation. '''Science builds on theory, yet the same theories can also lock us into a partial view of the world.''' This is not necessarily bad, yet the divide between inductive and deductive approaches has been haunting statistics just as many other branches of science. Some approaches in statistics almost entirely depend on deductive thinking, such as the [[ANOVA]]. Other approaches such as [[Clustering Methods|cluster analysis]] are widely inductive. However, all these different analyses can be used both in inductive and deductive fashion, and indeed they are. No wonder that statistics created great confusion. The ANOVA for example was a breakthrough in psychological research, yet the failure to reproduce many experiments highlights the limitations of the theories that are being pursued. Equal challenges can be raised for ecology, economy, and many other empirical branches of science. Only when we understand that our diverse theories offer mere partial explanations, shall these theories be settled in their proper places.\n\n===Reduce and reflect bias===\n'''[[Bias and Critical Thinking|Bias]] has been haunting research from the very beginning, because all humans are biased.''' Statistics has learned to quantify or even overcome some biases, for instance the one related to sampling or analysis are increasingly tamed. However, there are many more biases out there, and to this day most branches of science only had a rather singular focus on biases. In the future we may pool our knowledge and build on wider experience, and may learn to better reflect our biases, and through transparency and open communication, we may thus reduce them. It seems more than unclear how we will do this, but much is to be gained.\n\n===Allow for comparability===\n'''How can we compare different dimensions of knowledge?''' To give an example, how much worth in coin is courage? Or my future happiness? Can such things be compared, and evaluated? Derek Parfit wrote that we are irrational in the way how we value the distant future less as compared to the presence, even if we take the likelihood of this distant future becoming a reality into account. This phenomenon is called temporal discounting. Humans are strangely incapable of such comparisons, yet statistics have opened a door into a comparability that allows to unravel a new understanding of the comparisons in our head with other comparisons, or in other words, to contextualise our perspectives. Temporal discounting is already today playing less of a role because of teleconnections and global market chains. What would however be more important, is if people gained - through statistics - a deeper insight into their existence compared to everybody else. Such a radical contextualisation of ourselves would surely change our perspective on our role in the world."],"20":["System Thinking can be applied in any discipline to understand underlying structures and develop models of the system that is analysed. However, sustainability science relies heavily on System Thinking since it acknowledges the complex and lagged interrelationships within and in between ecological, economic, social and further systems. A Key Publication in this field was 'Thinking in Systems' by '''Donella Meadows''', who had been co-authoring the landmark 'Limits to Growth' before. Sustainability Science, which attempts to bridge the world how it is with the world how it ought to be, relies on System Thinking to understand how the world is and in which '[[Glossary|leverage points]]' one needs to intervene to bring about change. System Thinking can also be applied outside of scientific research, e.g. to analyze company-internal processes, for marketing purposes etc. (see e.g. 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nBefore explaining System Thinking, it should first be explained what is a 'system'.\n\n==== Systems, System Thinking, System Analysis & System Dynamics ====\nA system is a \"(...) network of multiple variables that are connected to each other through causal relationships\", based on which the network \"(...) expresses some sort of behaviour, which can only be characterized through observation as a whole\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.11). This behavior remains persistent in a variety of circumstances. More simply put, a system is a \"(...) collection of connected things (...) that influence one another.\" (Toole 2005, p.2) Both the collection of elements and their interactions are important elements of the system which is emphasized by saying that a system is 'more than a collection of its parts' (Arnold & Wade 2015, p.2).\n\nEvery system is \"(...) defined by its boundaries\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.13). The borders we draw for our system analysis influence which level of detail we apply to our view on the system, and which elements we investigate. System elements can be animate (animals, humans) or inanimate (rocks, rain), conceptual (motivation) or real (harvest), quantifiable (money) or rather qualitative (well-being) (2). For example, a system could be a tree, with the leaves, the stem and such elements interacting with each other, but also the forest in which our tree interacts with the soil, the weather, other plants, animals and inanimate objects. The system could also be the globe, where this forest interacts with other ecosystems, or the system in which Planet Earth interacts with the rest of the universe - our solar system. For more background on the definition of System Boundaries, please refer to [[System Boundaries|this entry.]]\n\n'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.","Soft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a 'system' an \"(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world\" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a 'system'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking''' according to Checkland. Source: Checkland 2000, p.18]]\n\nSystem Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: ''System Analysis'' and ''System Dynamics'' (1).\n\n''System Analysis'' \"(...) is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). ''System Analysis'', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below. For more information, refer to the entry on [[System Analysis]].\n\n''System Dynamics'', then, focuses on the interaction part of the system. It \"(...) refers to the re-creation of the understanding of a system and its feedbacks. It aims at exploring dynamic responses to changes within or from outside the system. (...) System Dynamics deals with mathematical representation of our mental models and is a secondary step after we have developed our mental model.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). System Dynamics, as the name suggests, enables the researcher to observe and measure the behavior of the system. The interactions between the individual elements are not just recreated, but the consequences of these interactions are quantified and assessed.\n\nSystem Thinking allows for a shift in the perception of [[Causality|causality]]. Instead of assuming linear causality (A causes B, B causes C) it allows for the integration of further influencing factors, as well as a more neutral depiction of the system at hand. C may now be seen as a property that [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|emerges]] from the relation between A and B, instead of perceiving it as a direct consequence of B. Haraldsson (2004, p.21) provides an illustrative example here: \"We start by asking the initial question: \"I want to understand how water flows into the glass and what I do to fill it up.\" Instead of looking at the action from an individual point of view, where the \"I am\" is the active part and at the centre of focus, we shift our perception to the structure of the action. The \"I am\" simply becomes a part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. Suddenly we have shifted out attention to the structure of the behavior and we can observe that the structure is causing the behavior. (...) We have now transformed the traditional linear thinking into a circular argument.\"\n\n==== Causal Loop Diagrams ====\nCausal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) are a crucial method for System Analysis since they allow for the modelling of systems. They make it possible \"(...) to 'map' the complexity of a problem of interest\" (McGlashan et al. 2016, p.2). A CLD allows us to not suppose a linear relationship between system elements, but rather understand cause and effect (1). It makes it possible to \"(...) understand how a behavior has been manifesting itself in a system so we can develop strategies to work with, or counteract the behavior. We also want to know to what extent and how the problem is connected with other 'systems'\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.20). By developing a CLD, one can visualize and thus better understand the feedback mechanisms that happen in a system (1). Therefore, they enable both a look at the structure as well as the processes in a system. The CLD also helps transfer system understanding (1). CLDs \"(...) provide a language for articulating our understanding of the dynamic, interconnected nature of our world. (...) By stringing together several loops, we can create a coherent story about a particular problem or issue.\" (Team TIP 2011, p.1)\n\n'''A Causal Loop Diagram consists of rather few elements:''' Variables, Causal Relationships and Polarity.","'''In short:''' Based on the idea of System Thinking, this entry discusses how to properly draw boundaries in systems.\n\n'''[[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|System thinking]] has emerged during the last decades as one of the most important approaches in sustainability science.''' Originating in the initial system theory, several conceptual frameworks and data analysis methodologies have been developed that aim to generate a better understanding of the interactive dynamics within a typically spatially bound system. While much attention has been hence drawn to a better theory development and subsequent application within a defined setting, less attention has been aimed at a definition of system boundaries. \n\n== The problem with System Boundaries ==\nWhile boundaries of some isolated systems as well as simple theoretical models can be rather clearly defined, much attention of the recent literature has actually focussed on the effects that systemic interactions create across distances, which have historically been considered separate (see for example [['https:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/teleconnections\/'|'teleconnections']] in atmospheric research). It is now evident that inland watersheds are linked to oceangraphic processes through freshwater and nutrient inputs, although these have historically and disciplinarily been examined separately. Furthermore, the nestedness of systems is another challenge - the idea that smaller systems are contained within, and are the constituent components of, larger systems such as organs within the larger integrated functionality of the human body. Some organs can be removed or replaced, but only in relation to the overall functions they provide and how they fit or match the context of the overall body (i.e, blood type or immune response). Government jurisdictions give other clear examples, where countries may contain several provinces as part of a federal system, which in turn can contain smaller administrative units, creating a multi-level administrative whole. \n\nThe debate often resonates around a void between the global and the local levels of social and ecological [[Glossary|scales]] such as space, jurisdiction, administration and even time (e.g., slow to fast). While the global level of most scales is trivial to define, the local level of a scale is less clear. What becomes clear in the definition process between global and local, is the ambiguity and often arbitrary nature of defining what the reality of the system being examined is. Normative choices have to be made, especially for defining research questions and hypotheses, i.e., what is a part of the specific system, what is not considered to be a part of it, and what is an important element that you want to know about? This has implications for the relationships and outcomes you want to investigate. '''Standardization of system definitions, or system defining [[Glossary|processes]], would also be a useful consensus activity to increase comparability and exchange within system science.''' Entire fields of research have thus emerged around normative understandings of what the optimal system level unit to examine might be, such as rural sociology, landscape ecology, coastal governance or micro-economics. What is evident - and becomes unclear - is the spectrum of definitions and choices between the two ends of a scale, and the degree to which the categorical differences in system boundary definitions are meaningful for how we analyse and interpret their functionality.\n\n[[File:System Boundaries - Farm.png|600px|thumb|center|'''Defining the system boundaries influences the scope and content of analysis'''.

We need to consider that some systems are either divided from larger or parallel systems, or that smaller systems are nested into other systems."],"21":["{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || '''[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]''' || '''[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n''Teaching is the best way to learn.''\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# '''Select the topic you want to learn more about.''' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don't go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain \"Economics\" or \"Physics\" in one go.\n# '''Find someone to talk to'''. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don't have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# '''Make notes.''' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and\/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# '''Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.''' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it.

Richard Feynman and his coauthors compiled these books in the 1960, yet to this day, many consider these volumes to be the most concise and understandable introduction to physics. Granted, Feynman's work is brilliant. '''At the same time, however, this fact also means that in the 1960s the majority of the knowledge necessary for an introduction in physics was already available.''' While we may consider that much happened ever since, students can still use these textbooks today. Something similar can be claimed for basic statistics, although it should be noted that physics is a scientific discipline, while statistics is a scientific method. Some disciplines use different methods, and many disciplines use statistics as a method. However, the final word on statistics has not been said, as the differences between [[A matter of probability|probability]] statistics and [[Bayesian Inference|Bayesian]] statistics are not yet deeply explored. Especially Bayesian statistics may provide a vital link to experiments, yet this has been hardly explored to date. Critical spirits may say that the teaching of statistics is often the most normal part of any sort of normal science study program, and this reputation led to statistics more often than not being characterized by a lack of excitement for students. We should not only know and teach the basics, but also engage in the discussion what these all may mean.\n \n'''Philosophy can be thought together well with statistics.''' Unfortunately until today they are not very much associated with each other.\nSomething surprisingly similar can be said about philosophy. While much of the basic principles are known, these are hardly connected. Philosophy hence works ever deeper on specifics, but most of its contributors move away from a unified line of thinking. This is what makes Derek Parfits work stand out, since he tried to connect the different dots, and it will be the work of the next decades to come to build on his work, and improve it if necessary.\n\nWhile philosophy and statistics both face a struggle to align different lines of thinking, it is even more concerning how little these two are aligned with each other. Statistics make use of philosophy at some rare occasions, for instance when it comes to the ethical dilemmas of negatively affecting people that are part of a study. While these links are vital for the development of specific aspects of statistics, the link between moral philosophy and statistics has hardly been explored so far. In order to enable statistics to contribute to the question how we ought to act, a systematic interaction is needed. I propose that exploring possible links is a first step, and we start to investigate how such connections work. The next step would be the proposal of a systematic conceptualisation of these different connections. This conceptualisation would then need to be explored and amended, and this will be very hard work, since both statistics and moral philosophy are scattered due to a lack of a unified theory, and hardly anyone is versatile in both fields.. This makes a systematic exploration of such a unifying link even more difficult to explore is the question who would actually do that. Within most parts of the current educational system, students learn either empirical research and statistics, or the deep conceptual understanding of philosophy. Only when we enable more researcher to approach from both sides - empirical and conceptual - will we become increasingly able to bridge the gap between these two worlds.","[[File:ConceptBayesianInference.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Bayesian Inference]]]]\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Bayesian Inference is a statistical line of thinking that derives calculations based on distributions derived from the currently available data.\n\n\n== Background == \n[[File:Bayesian Inference.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Bayesian Inference until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Bayesian' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n'''The basic principles behind Bayesian methods can be attributed to the probability theorist and philosopher, Thomas Bayes.''' His method was published posthumously by Richard Price in 1763. While at the time, the approach did not gain that much attention, it was also rediscovered and extended upon independently by Pierre Simon Laplace (1). Bayes' name only became associated with the method in the 1900s (3).\n\n'''The family of methods based on the concept of Bayesian analysis has risen the last 50 years''' alongside the increasing computing power and the availability of computers to more people, enabling the technical precondition for these calculation-intense approaches. Today, Bayesian methods are applied in a various and diverse parts of the scientific landscape, and are included in such diverse approaches as image processing, spam filtration, document classification, signal estimation, simulation, etc. (2, 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''Bayesian analysis relies on using probability figures as an expression of our beliefs about events.''' Consequently, assigning probability figures to represent our ignorance about events is perfectly valid in Bayesian approach. The probabilities, hence, depend on the current knowledge we have on the event that we are setting our belief on; the initial belief is known is \"prior\", and the probability figure assigned to the prior is called \"prior probability\". Initially, these probabilities are essentially subjective, as these priors are not the properties of a larger sample. However, the probability figure is updated as we receive more data. The final probabilities that we get after applying the Bayesian analysis, called \"posterior probability\", is based on our prior beliefs about the [[Glossary|hypothesis]], and the evidence that we collect:\n\n[[File:Bayesian Inference - Prior and posterior beliefs.png|450px|thumb|center|'''The probability distribution for prior, evidence, and posterior.''']]\n\nSo, how do we update the probability, and hence our belief about the event, as we receive new information? This is achieved using Bayes' Theorem.\n\n==== Bayes' Theorem ====\nBayes theorem provides a formal mechanism for updating our beliefs about an event based on new data. However, we need to establish some definitions before being able to understand and use Bayes' theorem.\n\n'''Conditional Probability''' is a probability based on some background information. If we consider two events A and B, conditional probability can be represented as:\n\n    P(A|B)\n\nThis representation can be read as the probability of event A occurring (or being observed) given that event B occurred (or B was observed). Note that in this representation, the order of A and B matters. Hence P(A|B) and P(B|A) are convey different information (discussed in the coin-toss example below).\n\n'''Joint Probability''', also called \"conjoint probability\", represents the probability of two events being true - i.e. two events occuring - at the same time. If we assume that the events A and B are independent, this can be represented as:\n\n    P(A\\ and\\ B)=P(B\\ and\\ A)= P(A)P(B)\n\nInterestingly, the conjoint probability can also be represented as follows:"],"22":["[https:\/\/www.theanalysisfactor.com\/the-difference-between-crossed-and-nested-factors\/ Difference between crossed & nested factors]: A short article\n\n[https:\/\/www.ohio.edu\/plantbio\/staff\/mccarthy\/quantmet\/lectures\/ANOVA-III.pdf Nested Designs]: A detailed presentation\n\n[https:\/\/support.minitab.com\/en-us\/minitab\/18\/help-and-how-to\/modeling-statistics\/regression\/supporting-topics\/regression-models\/model-reduction\/ Model reduction]: A helpful article\n\n[https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html Random vs. Fixed Factors]: A differentiation\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 Field Experiments in Agriculture]: Ronald Fisher's experiment\n\n[https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html Field Experiments in Psychology]: A famous example\n\n[https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 Field Experiments in Economics]: An example paper\n\n[https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ Field Experiments in Sociology]: Some examples\n\n===Videos===\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=10ikXret7Lk Types of Experimental Designs]: An introduction\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U Fixed vs. Random Effects]: A differentiation\n----\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:R examples]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","==== Random factors ====\nThis brings us to the next factor that can affect our model validity. There are many things we might want to know when creating a statistical model, but there may also be things that we do not want to know. Statistically speaking, these are ''random factors'' or ''random variables''. Regarding these, we explicitly exclude the variance that is created by these parts of the dataset, because we want to minimise their effects. An example would be a medical study that wants to investigate the effect of a certain drug on the recovery rate of some diseased patients. In such studies, the information whether a patient is a smoker or not is often included as a random factor, because smoking negatively affects many diseases and the respective recovery rates. We know that smoking makes many things worse (from a medical standpoint) and this is why such variables are excluded. More on random factors can be found [[ Field_experiments#Fixed_effects_vs._Random_effects | here]].\n\n==== The model ====\nThe next part of a [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis | statistical model]] that needs to be examined when discussing the limitations of statistics is the statistical test or model itself. Models differ in terms of their mathematical foundations. This can lead to some models being more complicated than others, relying on different measures of model performance, and are also sometimes differently utilised within different scientific communities or disciplines. Data visualisations showcase how different branches of sciences have different ways to approach how to [[Introduction_to_statistical_figures | show data in figures]], which can be diverse and often follow specific norms within different scientific disciplines.  \n\nThis is difficult to explain in a nutshell, but let me try: basically, different historical developments in the diverse disciplines, as well as the specific relation of a discipline towards the respective theory and topics, enable differences in how statistics are being utilised by different disciplines. Yet, there are also examples of exchanges and even coevolutionary patterns. For instance, the [[ANOVA]] started within agricultural science, but equally unleashed its potential in psychology, medicine and ecology, as these all rely strongly on the [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|testing of hypotheses.]] Econometrics and engineering build more strongly on [[Correlations | correlative]] testing, which is again related to the specifics of these disciplines. Most simple tests are [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Normativity | hardly being used these days]], a phenomena that unites almost all disciplines, yet sometimes even very [[Back_of_the_envelope_statistics | simple calculations]] can offer robust answers. However, the difference between scientific disciplines regarding their statistical use does not always make sense, and is not necessarily rooted in reasonable decisions.\n\n== Limitations of statistics within science ==\n'''Equally grave (and not necessarily always meaningful) is the [[Design Criteria of Methods|great divide]] between quantitative and qualitative branches within science.''' While we should acknowledge that there are clear limitations of knowledge driven from statistics, it is equally difficult to reject knowledge derived from quantitative methods altogether. It is well deserved that with the rise of positivism - which widely cemented its reign through quantitative methods and particularly statistics - a qualitative counter-culture established itself. However, this does by far not do justice to the highly creative and so desperately needed deeper unlocking of qualitative dimensions in research. [[Interviews]], [[Grounded Theory]], [[Ethnography|Ethnographic Observations]] and [[Content Analysis]] are examples of important methods being established that go way beyond previous methods, and some of these approaches have a [[History of Methods|long history]] of highly relevant applications in science. However, statistics is nevertheless embedded into a judgemental perspective, creating a dichotomy that has not always been of benefit for science. Some would argue that the positivist wars - and the subsequent science war and culture war - are on a long chain of interwoven conflicts that may have been solved by [[Bias and Critical Thinking|critical realism]].","====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes. Since a non-normal distribution may influence the outcome of the test, boxplots are a helpful visual aid, as these allow for a simple detection tool of non-normal distribution levels. \n\nEqually should ideally the variance be comparable across all levels, which is called '''[https:\/\/blog.minitab.com\/blog\/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis\/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia homoscedastic]'''. What is also important is the criteria of '''independence''', meaning that samples of factor levels should not influence each other. For this reason are for instance in ecological experiments plants typically planted in individual pots. In addition does the classical ANOVA assume a '''balanced design''', which means that all factor levels have an equal sample size. If some factor levels have less samples than others, this might pose interactions in terms of normals distribution and variance, but there is another effect at play. Larger sample sizes on one factor level may create a disbalance, where factor levels with larger samples pose a larger influence on the overall model result. \n\n====One way and two way ANOVA====\nSingle factor analysis that are also called '[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nvAMVY2cmok one-way ANOVAs]' investigate one factor variable, and all other variables are kept constant. Depending on the number of factor levels these demand a so called [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latin_square randomisation], which is necessary to compensate for instance for microclimatic differences under lab conditions.\n\nDesigns with multiple factors or '[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/analysis-of-variance-anova-3026693 two way ANOVAs]' test for two or more factors, which then demands to test for interactions as well. This increases the necessary sample size on a multiplicatory scale, and the degrees of freedoms may dramatically increase depending on the number of factors levels and their interactions. An example of such an interaction effect might be an experiment where the effects of different watering levels and different amounts of fertiliser on plant growth are measured. While both increased water levels and higher amounts of fertiliser right increase plant growths slightly, the increase of of both factors jointly might lead to a dramatic increase of plant growth.\n\n====Interpretation of ANOVA====\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-15 um 14.13.34.png|thumb|These boxplots are from the R dataset ToothGrowth. The boxplots which you can see here differ significantly.]]\nBoxplots provide a first visual clue to whether certain factor levels might be significantly different within an ANOVA analysis. If one box within a boxplot is higher or lower than the median of another factor level, then this is a good rule of thumb whether there is a significant difference. When making such a graphically informed assumption, we have to be however really careful if the data is normally distributed, as skewed distributions might tinker with this rule of thumb. The overarching guideline for the ANOVA are thus the p-values, which give significance regarding the difference between the different factor levels. \n\nIt can however also be relevant to compare the difference between specific groups, which is made by a '''[https:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/post-hoc\/ posthoc test]'''. A prominent example is the [https:\/\/sciencing.com\/what-is-the-tukey-hsd-test-12751748.html Tukey Test], where two factor levels are compared, and this is done iteratively for all factor level combinations. Since this poses a problem of multiple testing, there is a demand for a [https:\/\/www.statisticshowto.com\/post-hoc\/ Bonferonni correction] to adjust the p-value. Mechanically speaking, this is comparable to conducting several t-tests between two factor level combinations, and adjusting the p-values to consider the effects of multiple testing."],"23":["==Replication of experiments==\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 17.10.27.png|thumb|One famous example from the discipline of psychology is the Milgram shock experiment carried out by Stanley Milgram a professor from the Yale University in 1963.]]\nField experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments. Consider Occam\u2019s razor also when designing a study.\n\n==External Links==\n===Articles===\n\n[https:\/\/explorable.com\/field-experiments Field Experiments]: A definition\n\n[https:\/\/www.tutor2u.net\/psychology\/reference\/field-experiments Field Experiments]: Strengths & Weaknesses\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Field_experiment#Examples Examples of Field Experiments]: A look into different disciplines\n\n[https:\/\/conjointly.com\/kb\/experimental-design\/ Experimental Design]: Why it is important\n\n[https:\/\/isps.yale.edu\/node\/16697 Randomisation]: A detailed explanation\n\n[https:\/\/www.sare.org\/Learning-Center\/Bulletins\/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch\/Text-Version\/Basics-of-Experimental-Design Experimental Design in Agricultural Experiments]: Some basics\n\n[https:\/\/www.ndsu.edu\/faculty\/horsley\/RCBD.pdf Block Design]: An introduction with some example calculations\n\n[https:\/\/www.sare.org\/Learning-Center\/Bulletins\/How-to-Conduct-Research-on-Your-Farm-or-Ranch\/Text-Version\/Basics-of-Experimental-Design\/Common-Research-Designs-for-Farmers Block designs in Agricultural Experiments]:Common Research Designs for Farmers\n\n[https:\/\/www.theanalysisfactor.com\/the-difference-between-crossed-and-nested-factors\/ Difference between crossed & nested factors]: A short article\n\n[https:\/\/www.ohio.edu\/plantbio\/staff\/mccarthy\/quantmet\/lectures\/ANOVA-III.pdf Nested Designs]: A detailed presentation","[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-06-23 um 16.42.31.png|400px|right|thumb|'''The maxim ''Publish or Perish'' is dominating most of the scientific world today.''' Especially universities and scientific journals play an important role in this.]]\n\nThere are many facets that could be highlighted under such a provocative heading. Since Larry Laudan, it has become clear that the assumption that developments of science which are initiated by scientists are reasonable, is a myth at best. Take the example of one dominating [[Glossary|paradigm]] in science right now: Publish or perish. This paradigm highlights the current culture dominating most parts of science. If you do not produce a large amount of peer-reviewed publications, your career will not continue. This created quite a demand on statistics as well, and the urge to arrive at significant results that probably created frequent violations of Occam's razor (that is, things should be as complex as necessary, but as simple as possible). The reproducibility crisis in psychology is one example of these developments, yet all other disciplines building on statistics struggle to this end, too. Another problem is the fact that with this [[Questioning the status quo in methods|ever-increasing demand for \"scientific innovation\"]], models evolve, and it is hard to catch up. '''Thus, instead of having robust and parsimonious models, there are more and more unsuitable and overcomplicated models.''' The level of statistics at an average certainly increased. There are counter-examples where this is not necessarily the case, and rightly so. In medicine, for instance, the canon of statistics is fairly established and solidified for large parts of the research landscape. Thus, while many innovative publications are exploring new ways of statistics, and a highly innovative to this end, there is always a well-defined set of statistical methods that research can default on. Within many other branches of science, however, there is a certain increase in errors or at least slippery slopes. Statistics are part of the publish or perish, and with this pressure still rising, unreasonable actions in the application of statistics may still increase. Many other examples exist to this end, but this should highlight that statistics is not only still developing further, but statistics should also keep evolving, otherwise we may not be able the diversity of epistemological knowledge it can offer.\n\n== The imperfection of measurements ==\nAs a next step, let us look at the three pillars of Western ethics and how these are intertwined with statistics. We all discuss how we act reasonable, how we can maximize our happiness and how we live together as people. Hence reason, utilitarianism and the social contract are all connected to statistics in one way or the other. While this complicated relation may in the future be explored in more than a short wiki entry, lets focus on some examples here.\n\nOne could say that utilitarianism created the single largest job boost for the profession of statisticians. From predicting economic development, to calculating engineering problems, to finding the right lever to tilt elections, statistics are dominating in almost all aspects of modern society. '''Calculating the maximisation of utility is one of the large drivers of change in our globalised economy.''' But it does not stop there. Followers on social media and reply time to messages are two of many factors how to measure success in life these day, often draining their direct human interactions in the process, and leading to distraction or even torment. Philosophy is deeply engaged in discussing these conditions and dynamics, yet statistics needs to embed these topics, which are strongly related to ethics, more into their curriculum. If we become mercenaries for people with questionable goals, then we follow a long string of people that maximised utility for better or worse. History teaches us of the horrors that were conducted in the process of utility maximisation, and we need to end this string of willing aids to illegitimate goals. Instead, statistics should not only be about numbers, but also about the fact that these numbers have meaning. Numbers are not abstract representations of the world, but can have different meanings for different people. Hence numbers can add information that is missing, and can serve as a starting point for an often necessary deeper reflection.","For example the [https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/rcfs\/article\/4\/2\/155\/1555737#113865691 financial crisis from 2007], where many patterns where comparable to previous crisis, but other factors were different. Hence this crisis is comparable to many previous factors and patterns regarding some layers of information, but also novel and not transferable regarding other dynamics. We did however understand based on the single case of this financial crisis that certain constructs in our financial systems are corrupt if not broken. The contribution to develop the financial world further is hence undeniable, even so far that many people agree that the changes that were being made are certainly not enough. \n\nAnother prominent example of a single case or phenomena is the Covid pandemic that emerges further. While much was learned from previous pandemics, this pandemic is different, evolves different, and creates different ramifications. The impact of our societies and the opportunity to learn from this pandemic is however undeniable. While classical experiments evolve knowledge like pawns in a chess game, moving forward step by step, a crisis such as the Covid pandemic is more like the horse in a chess game, jumping over larger gaps, being less predictable, and certainly harder to master. The evolution of knowledge in an interconnected world often demands a rather singular approach as a starting point. This is especially important in normative sciences, where for instance in conservation biology many researchers approach solutions through singular case studies. Hence the solution orientated agenda of sustainability science emerged to take this into account, and further.\n\n[[File:Lueneburg 2030.jpg|thumb|left|A wonderful example for a bunch of real world experiments is the project L\u00fcneburg 2030+.

These types of experiments are currently widely explored in the literature, yet there is no coherent understanding of what real-world experiments are to date in the available literature, yet approaches are emerging. These experiments can however be seen as a continuation of the trend of natural experiments, where a solution orientated agenda tries to generate one or several interventions, the effects of which are tested often within singular cases, but the evaluation criteria are clear before the study was conducted. Most studies to date have defined this with vigour; nevertheless, the development of real-world experiments is only starting to emerge.\n\nFor more details on natural experiments, please refer to the entry on [[Case studies and Natural experiments]].\n\n\n== Experiments up until today ==\n[[File:Experiment Scopus.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Experiment until 2020.'''

One person or a group comes up with ideas, then envisions their implementation and finally reflects upon their feasibility in a circular process. The Disney Method may be used to come up with ideas for projects or products, to solve problems and conflicts, to develop strategies and to make decisions. The method was invented by Walt Disney who thought of a movie not only as a director, but also as an audience member and a producer to come up with the best possible result.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Productive brainstorming\n* Understanding for other perspectives\n* Strong team spirit \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe Disney method process is circular. A group of people (ideally five or six) is split into three different roles: the Dreamers, the Realists, the Critics. \n\n[[File:Disney Method.png|450px|thumb|right|The Disney Method process]]\n\nThe '''Dreamers'''...\n* try to come up with new ideas\n* are creative and imaginative and do not set themselves any limits\n* everything is possible!\n* Guiding questions: ''Which ideas come to mind? What would be an ideal solution to the problem?''\n\nThe '''Realists'''...\n* think about what needs to be done to implement the ideas\n* are practical and realistic\n* Guiding Questions: ''How does the idea feel? How could it be implemented? Who should do it and at what cost?''\n\nThe '''Critics'''...\n* look at the idea objectively and try to identify crucial mistakes\n* are critical, but constructive - they do not want to destroy the ideas, but improve them constructively.\n* Guiding Questions: ''What was neglected by the Dreamers and Realists? What can be improved, what will not work? Which risks exist?''\n\nEach role receives a specific area within a room, or even dedicated rooms or locations, that may also be decorated according to the respective role. '''The process starts with the Dreamers, who then pass on their ideas to the Realists, who pass their thoughts on to the Critics.''' Each phase should be approx. 20 minutes long, and each phase is equivalently important. \nAfter one cycle, the Critics pass back the feedback to the ideas to the Dreamers, who continue thinking about new solutions based on the feedback they got. Every participant should switch the role throughout the process (with short breaks to 'neutralize' their minds) in order to understand the other roles' perspectives. The process goes on for as long as it takes, until the Dreamers are happy about the ideas, the Realists are confident about their feasibility and the Critics do not have any more remarks.\n\nA fourth role (the neutral moderator) may be added if the process demands it. He\/she is then responsible for starting and ending the process and moderating the discussions.

With many participants, discussion rounds tend to be sprawling, slow and dominated by strong speakers. If you want to facilitate a discussion that is more effective, energetic, and inclusive, the World Caf\u00e9 is a helpful technique. It divides participants into moderated subgroups, who then wander together through a parcours of stations with different questions, all the while the atmosphere is relaxed and casual like in a caf\u00e9.\n\n== Goals ==\nSplitting big groups into subgroups fosters inclusive, energetic, effective and in-depth discussions: \n* reserved speakers can feel more comfortable speaking in a smaller group\n* the parcours format allows people to physically move through the room in between discussions\n* the moderator can steer the discussion towards unexplored issues with every new subgroup\n* every participant contributed to the collective results in the end\n\n== Getting started ==\nDepending on group size, room capacities and questions you want to discuss, different stations are set up (can be tables, boards, flipcharts etc.) with a moderator who will introduce the question and lead the discussion. The participants will be divided into as many subgroups as there are stations. Each subgroup will visit every station. The moderator welcomes the subgroup participants and introduces the question. Within a given time slot, the subgroups will discuss the question and write down their ideas and insights, before they then wander to the next station. The moderators remain with their station and welcome the next group. They present the question plus a broad overview of the insights of the former group and deepen the discussion with the new group. After the parcours has been completed by all subgroups, the moderators present the collective discussion results of each question to the full group. \n\nIt is helpful to have one moderator who is in charge of the clock and who manages the parcours direction.\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\nhttp:\/\/www.theworldcafe.com\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.methodenkartei.uni-oldenburg.de\/uni_methode\/world-cafe\/\n\n----\n__NOTOC__\n[[Category:Skills_and_Tools]]\n[[Category:Collaborative Tools]]\n[[Category:Team Size 11-30]]\n[[Category:Team Size 30+]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Dagmar M\u00f6lleken."],"25":["[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page.\n\nIn addition, GLMs are often a part of very specific parts of science. Whether researchers implement GLMs or not is often depending on their education: it is not guaranteed that everybody is aware of their necessity and able to implement these advanced models. What makes this even more challenging is that within larger analyses, different parts of the dataset may be built upon different distributions, and it can be seen as inconvenient to report diverse GLMs that are based on different distributions, particularly because these are then utilising different evaluative criteria. The ideal world of a statistician may differ from the world of a researcher using these models, showcasing that GLMs cannot be taken for granted as of yet. Often, researchers still prioritise to follow disciplinary norms rather than go for comparability and coherence. Hence the main weakness of GLMs is a failure or flaw in the application of the model, which can be due to a lack of experience. This is especially concerning in GLMs, since such mistakes are more easily made than identified.","===== ANCOVA =====\n'''If you have at least one categorical predictor, you should do an ANCOVA'''.

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting. Therefore we need to check if our dataset only includes numbers and then transform our dataset into a matrix, using <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>as.matrix()<\/syntaxhighlight> function.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata(\"mtcars\")\nmatcars <- as.matrix(mtcars)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nAlso, for better representation, we are going to rename the columns, giving them their full names. It is not a mandatory step, but it makes our heatmap more comprehensible.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfullcolnames <- c(\"Miles per Gallon\", \"Number of Cylinders\",\n                  \"Displacement\", \"Horsepower\", \"Rear Axle Ratio\",\n                  \"Weight\", \"1\/4 Mile Time\", \"Engine\", \"Transmission\",\n                  \"Number of Gears\", \"Number of Carburetors\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we are using the transformed dataset (matcars) to create the heatmap. Other used arguments are explained below.\n[[File:Heatmap.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\nheatmap(matcars, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, \n        scale = \"column\", labCol = fullcolnames, \n        margins = c(11,5))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n== How to interpret a heatmap? ==\n\nIn the default color palette the interpretation is usually the following: the darker the color the higher the responding value, and vice versa. For example, let\u2019s look at the feature <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>\u201cNumber of Carburetors\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight>. We can see that '''Maserati Bora''' has the darkest color, hence it has the largest number of carburetors, followed by '''Ferrari Dino''', which has the second-largest number of carburetors. While other models such as '''Fiat X1-9''' or '''Toyota''' have the lightest colors. It means that they have the lowest numbers of carburetors. This interpretation can be applied to every other column.","==Explanation of used arguments==\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Colv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Rowv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> are used to remove the dendrograms from rows and columns. A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects and is added on top of the heatmap by default if the argument is not specified. The main reason for removing it here is that it is a different method of data visualisation which is not mandatory for the heatmap representation and requires a separate article to review it fully.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>scale = \u201ccolumn\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to normalize the columns of the matrix (to absorb the variation between columns). As it was stated previously, normalization is needed due to the algorithm by which the colors are set. Here in our dataset, the values of features \u201cGross horsepower\u201d and \u201cDisplacement\u201d are much larger than the rest. Therefore, without normalization, these two columns will be all marked approximately equally high and all the other columns equally low. Normalizing means that we keep the relative values in each column but not the real numbers. In the interpretation sense it means that, for example, the same color of features \u201cMiles per Gallon\u201d and \u201cNumber of Cylinders\u201d of Mazda RX4 does not mean that the actual values are the same or approximately the same (placed in the same bin). It only means that the relative values of each of these cells in corresponding columns are the same or are in the same bin.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>margins<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to fit the columns and rows names into the graph. The reason we used it here is because of the renaming of the columns, which is resulted in longer names that did not fit well by themselves.\n\nColoring options for the heatmap\nThe choice of color for the heatmap is one of the most important aspects of creating an understandable and nice-looking representation of the data. If you do not specify the color (as in the example above) then the default color palette will be applied. However, you can use the argument <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>col<\/syntaxhighlight> and choose from a wide variety of palettes for coloring your heatmap.\n\nThere are two options of setting a color palette for the heatmap:\n* First option is to use the palettes from R: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>cm.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heat.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>rainbow()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>terrain.color()<\/syntaxhighlight>  or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>topo.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight> \n* The second option is to install color palettes packages such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>RColorBrewer<\/syntaxhighlight> \n\n==Additional materials==\n* [https:\/\/www.r-graph-gallery.com\/heatmap Other functions for building a heatmap]\n* [https:\/\/www.datanovia.com\/en\/blog\/how-to-normalize-and-standardize-data-in-r-for-great-heatmap-visualization\/ How and why we should normalize data for a heatmap]\n* [https:\/\/vwo.com\/blog\/heatmap-colors\/ How to choose the color palette for a heatmap]\n* [https:\/\/blog.bioturing.com\/2018\/09\/24\/heatmap-color-scale\/ Do's and Dont's in choosing a color palette for a heatmap]\n* [https:\/\/www.displayr.com\/what-is-dendrogram\/ What is a dendrogram]\n* [https:\/\/sustainabilitymethods.org\/index.php\/Clustering_Methods More about clustering methods and how to build a dendrogram in R]\n\n----\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:R examples]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Evgeniya Chetneva.","'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Treemaps.

Originally designed to visualize files on a hard drive and developed by Shneiderman and Johnson. They capture two types of information in the data: (1) the value of individual data points; (2) the structure of the hierarchy.\n__TOC__\n<br>\n\n== Definition ==\nTreemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) [[Glossary|data]]. They are composed of a series of nested rectangles (tiles) whose areas are proportional to the data they represent. Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then subdivided into smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. The conceptual idea is to break down the data into its constituent parts and quickly identify its large and small components.\n<br>\n<br\/>\n[[File:Switzerlandtreemap.png|400px|thumb|right|Fig.1: Switzerland imports in 2017. Source: commons.wikimedia.org]]\n'''Treemaps are used:''' <br>\n1. To study data with respect to two quantitative values: <br>\n\u2013 positive quantitative value standing for the size of the rectangle (area cannot be negative) and<br>\n\u2013 second or categorical quantitative value standing for the color of the individual rectangles.<br>\n2. To display very large amount of hierarchial data in a limited space.<br> \n3. To make a quick, high-level summary of the similarities and differences within one category as well as between multiple categories (not precise comparisons).\n<br>\n<br>\nThe efficient use of physical space and the intelligent color management make treemaps powerful visualization technique applied to a wide variety of domains. They are used to display significant amounts of information in financial, commercial, governmental and similar fields. The treemap on Fig.1 shows Switzerland imports in 2017.\n[[File:Motorbikestreemap.png|300px|thumb|right|Fig.2: Category-wise sales figure for motorbikes. Source: www.fusioncharts.com]]\n'''Adding new Dimensions.''' With the intelligent use of colors, new dimensions can be added to the diagram. The usual practice is to use color in different rectangles to indicate a second categorical or quantitative value. If color is used to express a quantitative value, it\u2019s strongly encouraged to use only one color (if all the numbers are positive) or two colors (one for negative and one for positive), and vary the intensity of the color to express precise value.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe following treemap (Fig.2) illustrates the category-wise (Street, Cruiser and etc.) sales figure for motorbikes. The size of the rectangles within each category indicates the relative number of sales. Different colors and color intensities show growth and declines of the motorbike sales. \u201cStatic\u201d shows that sales neither grew nor declined. Very intense orange indicates a big shift downward, and very intense green indicates a big shift upwards.\n\nFrom Fig.2 it can be concluded that appropriate use of color enables us to use tree maps to represent losses, declines in sales or other non-positive values. The second quantitative value is not represented by the area of the rectangle.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe way the rectangle is divided and arranged into sub-rectangles depends on '''the tiling algorithm''' used.\n<br>\n<br>\nMany tiling algorithms have been developed and here are some of them:\n<br>\n<br>\n'''Squarified''' - keeps each rectangle as square as possible. It also tries to order the consecutive elements of the dataset (blocks, tiles) in descending order from the upper left corner to the lower right corner of the graph.\n<br>\n<br>\n'''Slice and Dice''' uses parallel lines to divide a root into branches (large rectangles). Then they are subdivided into smaller rectangles representing sub-branches again by using parallel lines. At each level of the hierarchy the orientation of the lines is switched (vertical vs. horizontal)."],"27":["Many concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a. Ibn al-Haytham]. Emerging from the mathematics of antiquity and combining this with the generally rising investigation of physics, Alhazen was the first to manipulate [[Field_experiments|experimental conditions]] in a systematic sense, thereby paving the way towards the scientific method, which would emerge centuries later. Alhazen is also relevant because he could be considered a polymath, highlighting the rise of more knowledge that actually enabled such characters, but still being too far away from the true formation of the diverse canon of [[Design Criteria of Methods|scientific disciplines]], which would probably have welcomed him as an expert on one matter or the other. Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on '''the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.'''\n\n==== Before Enlightenment - ''Measure And Solve'' ====\n[[File:Normal_Mercator_map_85deg.jpg|thumb|300px|left|'''Mercator world map.''' Source: [https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mercator-Projektion Wikipedia]]] \n'''Another breakthrough that was also rooted in geometry was the compilation of early trade maps.''' While many European maps were detailed but surely not on scale (Ebstorfer Weltkarte), early maps still enabled a supra-regional trade. The real breakthrough was the [[Geographical Information Systems|Mercator map]], which was - restricted to the knowledge at the time - the first map that enabled a clear navigation across the oceans, enabling colonialism and Western dominions and domination of the world. This is insofar highly relevant for methods, because it can be argued that the surplus from the colonies and distant countries was one of the main drivers of the thriving of the European colonial rulers, their economies and consequently, their science. A direct link can be made between the [[Normativity of Methods|inequalities]] that were increased by colonialism and the thriving of Western science, including the development of scientific methods.\n\n[[File:printing-press-2.jpg|300px|thumb|left|'''Invention of the printing press'''.

A link can be made to translations and interpretations of the Bible, and many other religious discourses are indeed not different from deep text analysis and the derivation of interpretations. Hermeneutics go clearly a step further, and hence are one of the earliest and to date still most important scientific methods. [[Thought Experiments]] were another line of thinking that started to emerge more rapidly. By focussing on ''What if'' questions, scientists considered all sorts of questions to derive patterns of even law of nature ([https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/galileo\/ Galileo]) and also directed their view into the future. Thought experiments were in an informal way known since antiquity, yet during medieval times these assumptions became a trigger to question much of what was supposedly known. Through experiments they became early staring points for subsequent more systematic experimentation.","[[File:Somer_Francis_Bacon.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Francis Bacon.''' Source: [https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Francis_Bacon Wikipedia]]] \nIt was [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/francis-bacon\/ Francis Bacon] who ultimately moved out of this dominance of thinking and called for the importance of empirical inquiry. '''By observing nature and its phenomena, we are able to derive conclusion based on the particular.''' Bacon is thus often coined to be the father of 'the scientific method', an altogether misleading term, as there are many scientific methods. However, empiricism, meaning the empirical investigation of phenomena and the derivation of results or even rules triggered a scientific revolution, and also a specialization of different scientific branches. While Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had been a polymath less than a century ago, Bacon (1561-1626) triggered an increase in empirical inquiry that led to the deeper formation of scientific disciplines. Many others contributed to this development: [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/locke\/ Locke] claimed that human knowledge builds on experience, and [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/hume\/ Hume] propelled this into skepticism, casting the spell of doubt on anything that is rooted in belief or dogma. By questioning long standing knowledge, science kicked in - among other things - the door of god himself, a circumstance that is too large to be presented here in any sense. What is important however is that - starting from the previous age of diverse approaches to knowledge - the combination of empiricism on the one end, and the associated philosophical developments on the other end, the age of reason had dawned.\n\n[[File:Timeline of methods V2.jpg|600px|frame|center|'''A timeline of major breakthroughs in science.''' Source: own]]\n\n==== Enlightenment - ''Pathways To Scientific Disciplines'' ====\nThe age of reason triggered - among many other changes - the development of scientific disciplines much further as ever before. Scientific inquiry was enabled by an increasing influx of resources from the colonies, and biology, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, physics and so much more prospered. '''Early inquiries into these disciplines had often existed since centuries if not millennia, but now knowledge got explored at an exponential pace.''' Much of it was descriptive at first, including what would be considered natural history today. Yet, the early inquiries into the systematical determination and differentiation of organisms ([https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Carolus-Linnaeus Linn\u00e9]) laid the foundation of many other concepts. It was again the colonies that triggered a surplus, this time in basic material to generate more insight. Darwins theory, after all, would have been impossible without specimen from his journeys. While some thus looked into the natural world, other branches of science investigated society, and the first truly systematic case studies were designed in medicine. Hence we moved from experiments as a means of observation into [[Experiments|experimental inquiry]], paving the road to 20th century hypothesis testing. This demanded the testing of the observational outcome, a phenomenon that equally challenged scientists in astronomy. There, just as in experiments, it was recognized that although they tried to be diligent and use the latest available optical tools, there could still be an error that needed to estimated. This constituted a true application opportunity for statistics, leading to the rise of [[Category:Quantitative|quantitative]] methods.","'''Note:''' The German version of this entry can be found here: [[Scientific methods and societal paradigms (German)]].\n\n'''In short:''' This entry discusses how [[Glossary|scientific methods]] have influenced society - and vice versa.\n__NOTOC__\n== The role of scientific paradigms for society ==\nFrom early on, scientific [[Glossary|paradigm]]s were drivers of societal development. While much else may have happened that is not conveyed by the archaeological record and other accounts of history, many high cultures of the antiques are remembered for their early development of science. Early science was often either having a pronounced practical focus, such as in metallurgy, or was more connected to the metaphysical, such as astronomy. Yet even back then, the ontological (how we make sense of our knowledge about the world) and the epistemological (how we create our knowledge about the world) was mixed up, as astronomy also allowed for navigation, and much of the belief systems was sometimes rooted, and sometimes reinforced by astronomical science. Prominent examples are the star of Bethlehem, the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and the Mayan calendar. However, science was for the most part of the last two millennia in a critical relation to the metaphysical, as there was often a quest for ontological truths between religions and science. While the East was more open to allow science to thrive and made active use of its merits; in Europe, many developments were seen as critical, with Galileo Galileo being a prominent example. Since this changed with the [[History of Methods|Enlightenment]], science paved the way for the rise of the European empires, and with it the associated paradigms.\n\n== Three examples for an active interaction ==\nWhile the [[History of Methods|history of methods]] was already in the focus before, here we want to focus on how the development of scientific methods interacted with societal paradigms. It is often claimed that science is in the Ivory Tower, and is widely unconnected from society. While this cannot be generalised for all branches of science, it is clear that some branches of science are more connected to society than others. Let us have a look at three examples. \n\n==== Medicine ====\nA prominent example of a strong interaction is medicine, which has at its heart the care for the patient. However, this naive assumption cannot hold the diverse paradigms that influenced and build medicine over time. Today, ananmesis - the information gained by a physician by asking specific questions of a patient - gained in importance, and the interdisciplinary conferences of modern treatments combine different expertise with the goal of a more holistic recognition of the diseases or challenges of the individual patient. \n\n==== Engineering ====\nEngineering is another branch of science which builds on a long tradition, and has at its early stages quite literally paved the road for many developments of modernity. While factories and production processes are today also seen more critically, it has become clear already since Marx that the working condition of modern production are not independent of questions of inequality. In addition, production processes are shifting in order to enable more sustainable production processes, indicating another paradigm shift in engineering. \n\n==== Agricultural science ====\nThe last example, agricultural science, is also widely built around positivistic methodology of modern science, allowing of an optimisation of agricultural production in order to maximise agricultural yield, often with dire consequences. The so-called [https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/green-revolution-overview-1434948 'Green Revolution'] wreaked havoc on the environment, destroyed local livelihoods across the globe, and untangled traditional social-ecological systems into abusive forms that led ultimately to their demise in many parts of the world. \n\nThese three examples showcase how the development of modern science led to abusive, unbalanced, and often unsustainable developments that would in the long run trigger new paradigms such as the post-modernity, degrowths and other often controversially discussed alternatives to existing paradigms. Science was clearly an accomplice in driving many negative developments, and willingly developed the basis for many methodological foundations and paradigms that were seen in a different light after they were utilised over a longer time.\n\nEqually did society drive a demand onto scientific inquiry, demanding solutions from science, and thereby often funding science as a means to an end. Consequently, science often acted morally wrong, or failed to offer the deep [[Glossary|leverage points]] that could drive transformational [[Glossary|change]]. Such a critical view on science emerged partly out of society, and specifically did a view on empirical approaches emerge out of philosophy."],"28":["Multivariate data can be principally shown by three ways of graphical representation: '''ordination plots''', '''cluster diagrams''' or '''network plots'''. Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

A lot of information can be packed in one figure, basically all single variable information that is either proportional or absolute can be presented like this. It can be tricky if the number of categories is very high, which is when a miscellaneous category could be added to a part of an infographic. Infographics are a fine [[Glossary|art]], since the balance of information and aesthetics demands a high level of experience, a clear understanding of the data, and knowledge in the deeper design of graphical representation.\n\n\n'''Of course, there is more.''' While the figures introduced above represent a vast share of the visual representations of data that you will encounter, there are different forms that have not yet been touched. '''We have found the website [https:\/\/www.data-to-viz.com\/#connectedscatter \"From data to Viz\"] to be extremely helpful when choosing appropriate data visualisation.''' You can select the type of data you have (numeric, categoric, or both), and click through the exemplified figures. There is also R code examples.\n\n\n== How to visualize data in R ==\n'''The following overview includes all forms of data visualisation that we consider important.''' <br>\nBased on your data, have a look which forms of visualisation might be relevant for you. Just hover over the individual visualisation type and it will show you its name. It will also show you a quick example which this kind of visualisation might be helpful for. '''By clicking, you will be redirected to a dedicated entry with exemplary R code.'''<br>\n\nTip: If you are unsure whether you have qualitative or quantitative data, have a look at the entry on [[Data formats]]. Keep in mind: categorical (qualitative) data that is counted in order to visualise each category's occurrence, is not quantitative (= numeric) data. It's still qualitative data that is just transformed into count data. So the visualisations on the left do indeed display some kind of quantitative information, but the underlying data was always qualitative.","'''In short:''' This entry introduces you to the most relevant forms of [[Glossary|data]] visualisation, and links to dedicated entries on specific visualisation forms with R examples.\n\n== Basic forms of data visualisation ==\n__TOC__\nThe easiest way to represent count information are basically '''barplots'''. They are a bit over simplistic if they contain only one level of information such as three groups and their abundance, and can be more advanced if they contain two levels of information such as in stacked barplots. These can be shown as either absolute numbers or proportions, which may make a dramatic difference for the analysis or interpretation.\n\n'''Correlation plots''' ('xyplots') are the next staple in statistical graphics and most often the graphical representation of a correlation. Further, often also a regression is implemented to show effect strengths and variance. Fitting a [[Regression Analysis|regression]] line is often the most important visual aid to showcase the trend. Through point size or color can another information level be added, making this a really powerful tool, where one needs to keep a keen eye on the relation between correlation and causality. Such plots may also serve to show fluctuations in data over time, showing trends within data as well as harmonic patterns.\n\n'''Boxplots''' are the last in what I would call the trinity of statistical figures. Showing the variance of continuous data across different factor levels is what these plots are made of. While histograms reveal more details and information, boxplots are a solid graphical representation of the Analysis of Variance. A rule of thumb is that if one box is higher or lower than the median (the black line) of the other box, the difference may be signifiant.\n\n[[File:Xyplot.png|250px|thumb|left|'''A Correlation plot.'''

The left diagram shows absolute, the right one relative Barplots.]]\n\n\n[[File:Histogram structure.png|300px|thumb|right|'''A Histogram.''']]\nA '''histogram''' is a graphical display of data using bars (also called buckets or bins) of different height, where each bar groups numbers into ranges. They can help reveal a lot of useful information about numerical data with a single explanatory variable. Histograms are used for getting a sense about the distribution of data, its median, and skewness.\n\nSimple '''pie charts''' are not really ideal, as they camouflage the real proportions of the data they show. '''Venn diagrams''' are a simple way to compare 2-4 groups and their overlaps, allowing for multiple hits. Larger co-connections can either be represented by a '''bipartite plot''', if the levels are within two groups, or, if multiple interconnections exist, then a '''structural equation model''' representation is valuable for more deductive approaches, while rather inductive approaches can be shown by '''circular network plots''' (aka [[Chord Diagram]]).\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Venn Diagram example.png|200px|thumb|left|'''A Venn Diagram showing the number of articles in a systematic review that revolve around one or more of three topics.'''

With large data sets, training a ML model takes a large computational resources that can be costly in terms of time and money.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nMachine Learning gets criticized for not being as thorough as traditional statistical methods are. However, in their essence, Machine Learning techniques are not that different from statistical methods as both of them are based on rigorous mathematics and computer science. The main difference between the two fields is the fact that most of statistics is based on careful experimental design (including hypothesis setting and testing), the field of Machine Learning does not emphasize this as much as the focus is placed more on modeling the algorithm (find a function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>f(x)<\/syntaxhighlight> that predicts <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>y<\/syntaxhighlight>) rather than on the experimental settings and assumptions about data to fit theories [4].\n\nHowever, there is nothing stopping researchers from embedding Machine Learning techniques to their research design. In fact, a lot of methods that are categorized under the umbrella of the term Machine Learning have been used by statisticians and other researchers for a long time; for instance, ''k-means clustering'', ''hierarchical clustering'', various approaches to performing ''regression'', ''principle component analysis'' etc.\n\nBesides this, scientists also question how Machine Learning methods, which are getting more powerful in their predictive abilities, will be governed and used for the benefit (or harm) of the society. Jordan and Mitchell (2015) highlight that the society lacks a set of data privacy related rules that prevent nefarious actors from potentially using the data that exists publicly or that they own can be used with powerful Machine Learning methods for their personal gain at the other' expense [7]. \n\nThe ubiquity of Machine Learning empowered technologies have made concerns about individual privacy and social security more relevant. Refer to Dwork [8] to learn about a concept called ''Differential Privacy'' that is closely related to data privacy in data governed world.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nThe field of Machine Learning is going to continue to flourish in the future as the technologies that harness Machine Learning techniques are becoming more accessible over time. As such, academic research in Machine Learning techniques and their performances continue to be attractive in many areas of research moving forward.\n\nThere is no question that the field of Machine Learning has been able to produce powerful models with great data processing and prediction capabilities. As a result, it has produced powerful tools that governments, private companies, and researches alike use to further advance their objectives. In light of this, Jordan and Mitchell [7] conclude that Machine Learning is likely to be one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Russell, S., & Norvig, P.

The advances in the field of computer science have made working with large volumes of data very efficient. As the computational resources have increased exponentially over the past decades, we are now able to train more complex models that are able to perform specific tasks with astonishing results; so much so that it almost seems magical.\n\nThis article presents the different types of Machine Learning tasks and the different Machine Learning approaches in brief. If you are interested in learning more about Machine Learning, you are directed to Russel and Norvig [2] or Mitchell [3].\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe term \"Machine Learning\" does not refer to one specific method. Rather, there are three main groups of methods that fall under the term Machine Learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n=== Types of Machine Learning Tasks ===\n\n==== Supervised Learning ====\nThis family of Machine Learning methods rely on input-output pairs to \"learn\" rules. This means that the data that you have to provide can be represented as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> pairs where <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the input data (in the form of vectors or matrices) and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>y = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> is the output (in the form of vectors with numbers or categories that correspond to each input), also called ''true label''.","Once you successfully train a model using the input-output pair <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X, y)<\/syntaxhighlight> and one of the many ''training algorithms'', you can use the model with new data <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(X_new)<\/syntaxhighlight> to make predictions <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>(y_hat)<\/syntaxhighlight> in the future.\n\nIn the heart of supervised Machine Learning lies the [[Glossary|concept]] of \"learning from data\" and from the data entirely. This begs the question what exactly is learning. In the case of computational analysis, \"a computer program is said to learn from experience '''E''' with respect to some class of tasks '''T''' and performance measure '''P''', if its performance at tasks in '''T''', as measured by '''P''', improves with experience '''E'''.\"[3]\n\nIf you deconstruct this definition, here is what you have:\n* '''Task (T)''' is what we want the Machine Learning algorithm to be able to perform once the learning process has finished. Usually, this boils down to predicting a value ([[Regression Analysis|regression]]), deciding in which category or group a given data falls into (classification\/clustering), or solve problems in an adaptive way (reinforcement learning).\n* '''Experience (E)''' is represented by the data on which the learning is to be based. The data can either be structured - in a tabular format (eg. excel files) - or unstructured - images, audio files, etc.\n* '''Performance measure (P)''' is a metric, or a set of metrics, that is used to evaluate the efficacy of the learning process and the \"learned\" algorithm. Usually, we want the learning process to take as little time as possible (i.e. we want training time time to be low), we want the learned algorithm to give us an output as soon as possible (i.e. we want prediction time to be low), and we want the error of prediction to be as low as possible.\n\nThe following figure from the seminal book \"Learning from Data\" by Yaser Abu Mostafa [1] summarizes  the process of supervised learning summarizes the concept in a succinct manner:\n\n[[File:Mostafa Supervised Learning.png|thumb|The Learning Diagram from \"Learning from Data\" by Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, & Lin (2012)]]\n\nThe ''target function'' is assumed to be unknown and the training data is assumed to be based on the target function that is to be estimated. The models that are trained based on the training data are assessed on some error measures (called ''metrics'') which guide the strategy for improving upon the Machine Learning algorithm that was \"learned\" in the previous steps. If you have enough data, and adopted a good Machine Learning strategies, you can expect the learned algorithm to perform quite well with new input data in the future.\n\n'''Supervised learning tasks can be broadly sub-categorized into ''regression learning'' and ''classification learning''.''' \n\nIn ''regression learning'', the objective is to predict a particular value when certain input data is given to the algorithm. An example of a regression learning task is predicting the price of a house when certain features of the house (eg. PLZ\/ZIP code, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, garage size, energy raging, etc.) are given as an input to the Machine Learning algorithm that has been trained for this specific task.\n\nIn ''classification learning'', the objective is to predict which ''class'' (or ''category'') a given observation\/sample falls under given the characteristics of the observation. There are 2 specific classification learning tasks: ''binary classification'' and ''multiclass classification''. As their names suggest, in binary classification, a given observation falls under one of the two classes (eg. classifying whether an email is spam or not), and in multiclass classification, a given observation falls under one of many classes (eg. in ''digit recognition'' task, the class for a picture of a given hand-written digit can range from 0 to 9; there are 10 classes).\n\n==== Unsupervised Learning ====\nWhereas supervised learning is based on pairs of input and output data, unsupervised learning algorithms function based only on the inputs: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)<\/syntaxhighlight> and are rather used for recognizing patterns than for predicting specific value or class."],"30":["Please refer to this [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi video series from 3blue1brown] for more on Neural Networks.\n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Machine Learning techniques perform very well - sometimes better than humans- on variety of tasks (eg. detecting cancer from x-ray images, playing chess, art authentication, etc.)\n* In a variety of situations where outcomes are noisy, Machine Learning models perform better than rule-based models.\n* Even though many methods in the field of Machine Learning have been researched quite extensively, the techniques still suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability.\n* Reproducibility crisis is a big problem in the field of Machine Learning research as highlighted in [6].\n* Machine Learning approaches have been criticized as being a \"brute force\" approach of solving tasks.\n* Machine Learning techniques only perform well when the dataset size is large. With large data sets, training a ML model takes a large computational resources that can be costly in terms of time and money.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nMachine Learning gets criticized for not being as thorough as traditional statistical methods are. However, in their essence, Machine Learning techniques are not that different from statistical methods as both of them are based on rigorous mathematics and computer science. The main difference between the two fields is the fact that most of statistics is based on careful experimental design (including hypothesis setting and testing), the field of Machine Learning does not emphasize this as much as the focus is placed more on modeling the algorithm (find a function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>f(x)<\/syntaxhighlight> that predicts <syntaxhighlight lang=\"text\" inline>y<\/syntaxhighlight>) rather than on the experimental settings and assumptions about data to fit theories [4].\n\nHowever, there is nothing stopping researchers from embedding Machine Learning techniques to their research design. In fact, a lot of methods that are categorized under the umbrella of the term Machine Learning have been used by statisticians and other researchers for a long time; for instance, ''k-means clustering'', ''hierarchical clustering'', various approaches to performing ''regression'', ''principle component analysis'' etc.\n\nBesides this, scientists also question how Machine Learning methods, which are getting more powerful in their predictive abilities, will be governed and used for the benefit (or harm) of the society. Jordan and Mitchell (2015) highlight that the society lacks a set of data privacy related rules that prevent nefarious actors from potentially using the data that exists publicly or that they own can be used with powerful Machine Learning methods for their personal gain at the other' expense [7]. \n\nThe ubiquity of Machine Learning empowered technologies have made concerns about individual privacy and social security more relevant. Refer to Dwork [8] to learn about a concept called ''Differential Privacy'' that is closely related to data privacy in data governed world.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nThe field of Machine Learning is going to continue to flourish in the future as the technologies that harness Machine Learning techniques are becoming more accessible over time. As such, academic research in Machine Learning techniques and their performances continue to be attractive in many areas of research moving forward.\n\nThere is no question that the field of Machine Learning has been able to produce powerful models with great data processing and prediction capabilities. As a result, it has produced powerful tools that governments, private companies, and researches alike use to further advance their objectives. In light of this, Jordan and Mitchell [7] conclude that Machine Learning is likely to be one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Russell, S., & Norvig, P.

Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.\n\nAlso, each scientific method that is described on this Wiki is categorized according to the Wiki's underlying [[Design Criteria of Methods]].<br\/>\n'''This means that each method fulfills one or more categories of each of the following criteria:'''\n<br\/>\n* [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] - [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n* [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] - [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n* Spatial scales: [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] - [[:Category:System|System]] - [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n* Temporal scales: [[:Category:Past|Past]] - [[:Category:Present|Present]] - [[:Category:Future|Future]]\nYou can click on each category for more information and all the entries that belong to this category.\n<br\/>\n\n\n=== Which methods can you learn about? ===\nSee all methods that have been described on this Wiki so far:\n<categorytree mode=\"pages\" hideroot=\"on\">Methods<\/categorytree>\n<br>\nWe also have what we call '''Level 2''' overview pages. <br>\nOn these pages, we present everything that is necessary for a specific field of methods in a holistic way.

It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances.\n\n'''Inductive vs. deductive'''\nSome branches of science try to verify or falsify hypotheses, while other branches of science are open towards the knowledge being created primarily from the data. Hence the difference between a method that derives [[Glossary|theory]] from data, or one that tests a theory with data, is often exclusive to specific branches of science. To this end, out of the larger availability of data and the already existing knowledge we built on so far, there is a third way called abductive reasoning. This approach links the strengths of both [[Glossary|induction]] and [[Glossary|deduction]] and is certainly much closer to the way how much of modern research is actually conducted. \n\n'''Scales'''\nCertain scientific methods can transcend spatial and temporal scales, while others are rather exclusive to a specific partial or temporal scale. While again this does not make one method better than another, it is certainly relevant since certain disciplines almost focus exclusively on specific parts of scales. For instance, psychology or population ecology are mostly preoccupied with the individual, while macro-economics widely work on a global scale. Regarding time there is an ever increasing wealth of past information, and a growing interest in knowledge about the future. This presents a shift from a time when most research focused on the presence. \n\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods]]\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Critical Theory & Bias ===\n'''Critical theory'''\nThe rise of empiricism and many other developments of society created critical theory, which questioned the scientific [[Glossary|paradigm]], the governance of systems as well as democracy, and ultimately the norms and truths not only of society, but more importantly of science. This paved the road to a new form of scientific practice, which can be deeply normative, and ultimately even transformative.  \n\n'''The pragmatism of [[Glossary|bias]]'''\nCritical theory raised the alarm to question empirical inquiry, leading to an emerging recognition of bias across many different branches of science. With a bias being, broadly speaking, a tendency for or against a specific construct (cultural group, social group etc.), various different forms of bias may flaw our recognition, analysis or interpretation, and many forms of bias are often deeply contextual, highlighting the presence or dominance of constructed groups or knowledge.","'''Note:''' This entry focuses especially on Methods of Sustainability Science. For a more general conceptual view on Methods, please refer to the entry on the [[Design Criteria of Methods]].\n\n'''In short:''' In this entry, you will find out more about how we can distinguish and design our methodological approaches in Sustainability Science.\n\n== Design Criteria in Sustainability Science - ''Why?'' ==\nThe [[Design Criteria of Methods|design criteria of methods]] that I propose for all methods - quantitative vs. qualitative, inductive vs. deductive, spatial and temporal scales - are like the usual suspects of scientific methods. Within normal science, these design criteria are what most scientists may agree upon to be central for the current debate and development about methods. Consequently, '''it is important to know these ''normal science'' design criteria also when engaging with sustainability science.''' However, some arenas in science depart from the current paradigm of science - ''sensu strictu'' [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/thomas-kuhn\/#DeveScie Kuhn] - and this means also that they depart potentially from the design criteria of the normal sciences. \n\nThe knowledge science currently produces is not enough to solve the problems we currently face. In order to arrive at new solutions, we need to re-consider, adapt and innovative the current raster of methods in science. Many methods that are long established are valuable, and all scientific methods have their [[History of Methods|history and origin]], and thus are important. Nevertheless, it becomes more and more clear that in order to arrive at solutions for the problems we currently face, we need to consider if we need methodological innovation. In the past,  methodological innovation worked in one of these ways:\n# new methods were invented,\n# new combinations of methods were attempted,\n# and methods were re-designed to be applied in a novel context where they had never been used before. \nWhile all this is fascinating in itself, here I present a different approach towards an amendment of the methodological canon, for one simple reason: Developing the methodological canon of science takes experience in the application of scientific methods, and ideally also contextual experience in diverse methodological approaches. While I am personally deeply critical about scientific disciplines, this is a good argument that in order to become versatile in scientific methods, you may need to channel your development towards being versatile in scientific methods based on textbook knowledge. Normal sciences have textbooks to teach their methodological canon, and while I think we need to be critical of these methodological approaches, they can have a lot of value. If you ask why, the I would say simply, because you cannot re-apply methods in a different context or attempt recombinations of methods if you are not experienced in the application of methods. To this end, it is important to highlight that these methods only look at parts of reality, which is the main reason for being critical. [[Bias and Critical Thinking|Bias]] and the fact that accompanying [[Levels of Theory|paradigms and theoretical viewpoints]] of specific methods restrict the validity of specific methods makes me even more critical. Nevertheless, there is no alternative to building experience than through applying methods within active research. You need to get your hands dirty to get experience. Here, I propose that we start with the knowledge we want to produce, and the goal we aim at to produce this knowledge. If we want to empower stakeholders, we need to be aware which methods out of the existing canon might help us, and how we may need to combine these methods in order to produce the knowledge we aim at. Therefore, we present three types of design criteria that serve as a basis for reflection of what knowledge we want to produce.\n\n== Key Competencies in Sustainability ==\nIn 2011, Wiek et al. analyzed the prevalent literature and presented five Key Competencies that students of Sustainability Science should strive for. This is an excellent scheme to be reflexive about the [[Glossary|competencies]] you want to gain, and to get a better understanding on which competencies can be aimed at through specific methods. These competencies are as follows:\n* ''Systems Thinking'': Systems Thinking competency is the ability to analyze and understand [[Glossary|complex systems]] including the dynamics in the interrelation of their parts. Systems thinking integrates different domains (society, environment, economy, etc.) as well as different scales (from local to global). \n\n* ''Anticipatory'': Anticipatory competency describes the ability to develop realistic scenarios of future trajectories within complex systems, including positive (e.g. a carbon-neutral city) and negative (e.g. flooding stemming from climate change) developments. This may include rigorous concepts as well as convincing narratives and visions."],"32":["If you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises.

Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

Source: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Noble_Eightfold_Path Wikipedia], Ian Alexander, CC BY-SA 4.0]]\nMindfulness is a [[Glossary|concept]] with diverse facets. In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative [[Glossary|assumptions]] that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the context of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.\n\n== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having \"no mind\", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you. Source: Headspace]]\n\nDuring the last decades mindfulness took a strong tooting in the western world, and the commercialisation of the principle of mindfulness led to the development of several approaches and even apps, like Headspace, that can introduce lay people to a regular practice. The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.","'''Soft skills'''<br>\nAmong the diverse term of soft skills are personal traits and approaches that basically help us to interact. While this could be associated to group work (see above), I think it is good to make a mind map that you keep updating and exchange about with others. This is nothing that you need to obsess about, but more like a conscious and reflexive diary of your own personal development. Actually, a research diary can be a good first step. Also, if you witness others that excel at a certain soft skill, approach them and ask them how they learned their respective skills. It is also quite helpful -surprise- to practice. Presentations are something that are often not right the first time, and constructive feedback from critical people that you trust goes a long way. Much of the literature and other resources on soft skills are often over-enthusiastic, and promise the one and only best approach. Do not let yourself be fooled by such simple fixes, some of the soft skill literature is rather fringe. Still, new approaches to knowledge and interaction await, much can be gained, and only a bit of time may be lost. Why not giving another soft skill a go? The most important step is then to try it really out. Doing meditation once will tell you nothing about it, yet after some weeks you may perceive some changes. Your first World Caf\u00e9 was a failure? Well, try it again, several times, in different settings. For soft skills you need to stay open minded.\n\n'''Digital natives?'''<br>\nWe are awash with information to the brim, and continuously on the edge of drowning in it. Mastering all things digital may be one of the most important skills in this age and place. I think the most important rule to this end is: Less is more. Evidence how bad too much exposure to the digital world seems to be is mounting. Social media made many promises, yet I am not sure how many were kept. I can acknowledge that it can create meaningful linkages, build capacity, and even be a lifeline to your distant friend. Nevertheless, I would propose to be very reflexive which emotions are triggered by social media within you. This may lead to the conclusion to detox. The same holds true for all things extreme, namely binge watching, youtube or Spiegel Online. Instead you need to become versatile in a word processor, Powerpoint, maybe a graphical software, and get a hold of your direct digital communication. E-mail is still a thing, and writing a good e-mail is a skill that is equally admirable and often missed out on by students. I have been there. Again, practice goes a long way. Also, be conscious about data structure, backups, and online plans. You should be able to impress others with you digital skills. This will open many doors, and tilt many opinions towards your direction.

The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|'''MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters\/bubbles, as in this example.''' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols. Source: [https:\/\/www.thetutorteam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/shutterstock_712786150.jpg thetutorteam.com]]]\n\n'''A Mindmap enables the visual arrangement of various types of information, including tasks, key concepts, important topics, names and more.''' It allows for a quick overview of all relevant information items on a topic at a glance. It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings. A Mindmap can also be a good tool for a [[Glossary|brainstorming]] process, since it does not focus too much on the exact relationships between the visualised elements, but revolves around a more intuitive approach of arranging information.\n\nThe central topic is written into the center of the [[Glossary|visualisation]] (e.g. a whiteboard, with a digital tool, or a large horizontally arranged sheet of paper). '''This central topic can be see as a city center on a city map, and all relevant information items then are arranged around it like different districts of the city.''' The information items should focus on the most important terms and data, and omit any unncessary details. These elements may be connected to the central topic through lines, like streets, or branches, resulting in a web structure. '''Elements may be subordinate to other elements, indicating nestedness of the information.''' Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections.\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\n''Sources:''\n* [https:\/\/www.mindmapping.com\/de\/mind-map MindMapping.com - Was ist eine Mindmap?]]\n* Tony Buzan. 2006.

Here, the learner should focus on a specific focus question and\/or text item, activity, or problem to structure the presented elements and hierarchies around, and to contextualize the map by. As the authors highlight, often, \"learners tend to deviate from the focus question and build a concept map that may be related to the domain, but which does not answer the question. It is often stated that the first step to learning about something is to ask the right questions\".\n# After defining the domain of knowledge and focus question or problem, 15-25 '''key concepts should be identified and ranked''' according to their specificity. In a concept map, more general, broad concepts are on the top of the map, while more specific concepts are found below, resulting in a hierarchy from top to bottom. So the concepts should be ordered accordingly in a list first.\n# Then, a preliminary concept map is created, either digitally (with the 'official' IHMC CmapTools software, see below) or by using Post-Its and a whiteboard. Concepts can and should be moved around iteratively. Propositions  - connections between concepts with text - are added to the map to highlight and explain relationships between concepts. When a first good draft exists, one identifies cross-links, which are relationships between separate areas of the map, to further highlight conceptual linkages. Lastly, '''constant revision is applied''' and concepts can be re-positioned to further improve the map.\n\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\n* This entry was created based on the extensive entry by Novak & Canas (2008), available [http:\/\/cmap.ihmc.us\/docs\/theory-of-concept-maps.php here].

The original underlying idea was to analyze how children learn, assuming that they do so by assimilating new concepts and positioning these in a cognitive conceptual framework. The idea of Concept Maps emerged from the demand for a form of assessing these conceptual understandings.\n\nImportantly, while Concept Maps are often applied in research, teaching or planning, they should not be confused with the mixed methods approach of [[Group Concept Mapping]]. The latter emerged based on Concept Maps in the 1980s, but is a more structured, multi-step process. A Concept Map further differs from a [[Mindmap]] in that the latter are spontaneous, unstructured visualisations of ideas and information around one central topic, without a hierarchy or linguistic homogeneity, and do not necessarily include labeled information on how conceptual elements relate to each other.\n\nConcept Maps '''help identify a current state of knowledge''' and show gaps within this knowledge, e.g. a lack of understanding on which elements are of importance to a question or topic, and how concepts are interrelated. Identifying these gaps helps fill knowledge gaps. Therefore, they can be a helpful tool for students or anyone learning a new topic to monitor one's own progress and understanding of the topic, and how this changes as learning units continue.\n\nFurther, Concept Maps can be '''a way of approaching a specific question''' or problem and support a systematic solution-development process. The visual representation of all relevant elements nconcerning a specific topic can thus help create new knowledge. There are even more imaginable purposes of the approach, including management and planning, creative idea-generation and more.\n\n[[File:Concept Map Example 2.png|500px|thumb|center|'''This example from Novak (2016, p.178) shows how a student's conceptual understanding of a topic develops over time.''' It illustrates how Concept Maps can help identify knowledge gaps or flaws (which are existent still in the map below), how much (and what kind of) learning process was made over time, and what to focus on in future learning.

Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: '''Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and\/or continuous]] independent variables'''. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.\n\nOften, these models serve as a baseline for the whole scheme of analysis, and thus already help researchers to design and plan their whole data campaign. Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models.","While psychology, medicine, agricultural science, biology and later ecology thus thrived in their application of experimental designs and studies, there was also an increasing recognition of information that was creating [[Bias and Critical Thinking|biases]] or otherwise falsely skewed the results. '''The ANOVA hence became amended by additional modifications, ultimately leading to more advanced statistics that were able to focus on diverse statistical effects''', and reduce the influence of skews rooted, for instance, in sampling bias, statistical bias or other flaws. Hence, [[Mixed-Effect Models]] became an advanced next step in the history of statistical models, leading to more complex statistical designs and experiments, taking more and more information into account. In addition, meta-analytical approaches led to the combination and summarising of several case studies into a systematic overview. This was the dawn of a more integrational understanding of different studies that were combined into a [[Meta-Analysis]], taking different contexts of the numerous studies into account as well. In addition, research also focused more and more onto a deeper understanding of individual case studies, with a stronger emphasis on the specific context of the respective case. Such singular cases have been of value in medical research for decades now, where new challenges or solutions are frequently published despite the obvious lack of a wider contribution. Such medical case studies report novel findings, emerging problems or other so far unknown case dynamics, and often serve as a starting point for further research. Out of such diverse origins such as [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|system thinking]], Urban Research, [[Ethnography]] and other fields in research, [[Living Labs & Real World Laboratories|real world experiments]] emerged, which take place in everyday social or cultural settings. The rigid designs of laboratory or field experiments is traded off for a deeper understanding of the specific context and case. While real world experiments emerged some decades ago already, they are only starting to gain wider recognition. All the while, the reproducibility crisis challenges the classical laboratory and field experiments, as a wider recognition that many results - for instance from psychological studies - cannot be reproduced. All this indicates that while much of our scientific knowledge is derived from experiments, much remains to be known, also about the conduct of experiments themselves.\n\n----\n[[Category: Normativity_of_Methods]]\n[[Category: Methods]]\n[[Category: Statistics]]\n[[Category: Qualitative]]\n[[Category: Deductive]]\n[[Category: Individual]]\n[[Category: System]]\n[[Category: Global]]\n[[Category: Present]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","W\u00e4hrend Psychologie, Medizin, Agrarwissenschaft, Biologie und sp\u00e4ter auch die \u00d6kologie auf diese Weise in der Anwendung von Versuchspl\u00e4nen und Studien gediehen, gab es auch eine zunehmende Anerkennung von Informationen, die [[Bias and Critical Thinking|Bias]] erzeugten oder die Ergebnisse anderweitig verzerrten.

Dar\u00fcber hinaus konzentrierte sich die Forschung mehr und mehr auf ein tieferes Verst\u00e4ndnis einzelner Fallstudien, wobei der spezifische Kontext des jeweiligen Falles st\u00e4rker betont wurde. Solche Einzelfallstudien sind in der medizinischen Forschung seit Jahrzehnten von Wert, wo trotz des offensichtlichen Mangels an einem breiteren Beitrag h\u00e4ufig neue Herausforderungen oder L\u00f6sungen ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden.

There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many studies in medicine that investigate how a certain drug works on people to cure a disease. To this end, you want to know the effect the drug has on the prognosis of the patients. What you do not want to know is whether people are worse off if they are older, have a lack of exercise or an unhealthy diet. All these single effects do not matter for you, because it is well known that the prognosis often gets worse with higher age, and factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet choices. What you may want to know, is whether the drug works better or worse in people that have unhealthy diet choice, are older or lack regular exercise. These interaction can be meaningfully investigated by Mixed Effect Models. '''All positive factors' variance is minimised, while the effect of the drug as well as its interactions with the other factors can be tested.''' This makes Mixed Effect Models so powerful, as you can implement them in a way that allows to investigate quite complex hypotheses or questions.\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of Mixed Effect Models is the level of experience that is necessary to implement them in a meaningful way. Designing studies takes a lot of experience, and the current form of peer-review does often not allow to present the complex thinking that goes into the design of advanced studies (Paper BEF China design). There is hence a discrepancy in how people implement studies, and how other researchers can understand and emulate these approaches. Mixed Effect Models are also an example where textbook knowledge is not saturated yet, hence books are rather quickly outdated, and also often do not offer exhausting examples to real life problems researchers may face when designing studies. Medicine and psychology are offering growing resources to this end, since here the preregistration of studies due to the reproducibility crisis offers a glimpse in the design of scientific studies.\n\nThe lack of experience in how to design and conduct Mixed Effect Models-driven studies leads to the critical reality that more often than not, there are flaws in the application of the method. While this got gradually less bad over time, it is still a matter of debate whether every published study with these models does justice to the original idea. Especially around the millennium, there was almost a hype in some branches of science regarding how fancy Mixed Effect Models were considered, and not all applications were sound and necessary. Mixed Effect Models can also make the world more complicated than it is: sometimes a regression is just a regression is just a regression.\n\n==  Normativity ==\nMixed Effect Models are the gold standard when it comes to reducing complexities into constructs, for better or worse. All variables that go into a Mixed Effect Model are normative choices, and these choices matter deeply. First of all, many people struggle to decide which variables are about fixed variance, and which variables are relevant as random variance. Second, how are these variables constructed - are they continuous or categorical, and if the latter, what is the reasoning behind the category levels? Designing Mixed Effect Modell studies is thus definitely a part of advanced statistics, and this is even harder when it comes to integrating non-designed datasets into a Mixed Effect Model [[Glossary|framework]]. Care and experience are needed to evaluate sample sizes, variance across levels and variables. This brings us to the most crucial point: Model inspection.","Another very important point regarding Mixed Effect Models is that they - probably more than any statistical method - remark the point where experts in one method (say for example interviews) now needed to learn how to conduct interviews as a scientific method, but also needed to learn advanced statistics in the form of Mixed Effect Models. This creates a double burden, and while learning several methods can be good to embrace a more diverse understanding, it is also challenging, and highlights a new development. Today, statistical analysis are increasingly outsourced to experts, and I consider this to be a generally good development. In my own experience, it takes a few thousand hours to become versatile at Mixed Effect Models, and modern science is increasingly built on collaboration.\n\n== Outlook ==\nIn terms of Mixed Effect Models, language barriers and the norms of specific disciplines are rather strong. Explaining the basics of these advanced statistics to colleagues is an art in itself, just as the experience of researchers being versatile in [[Semi-structured Interview|Interview]]s cannot be reduced into a few hours of learning. Education in science needs to tackle this head on, and stop teaching statistics that are outdated and hardly published. I suggest that at least on a Master's level, in the long run, all students from the quantitative domain should be able to understand the preconditions and benefits of Mixed Effect Models, but this is something for the distant future. Today, PhD students being versatile in Mixed Effect Models are still outliers. Let us all hope that this statement will be outdated rather sooner than later. Mixed Effect Models are surely powerful and quite adaptable, and are increasingly becoming a part of normal science. Honouring the complexity of the world while still deriving value statements based on statistical analyses has never been more advanced on a broader scale. '''Still, statisticians need to recognize the limitations of real world data, and researchers utilising these need to honour the preconditions and pitfalls of these analyses'''. Current science is in my perception far away from reporting reproducible analyses, meaning that one and the same dataset will be differently analysed by Mixed Effect Model approaches, partly based on experience, partly based on differences between disciplines, and probably also because of many other factors. Mixed Effect Models need to be consolidated and unified, which would make normale science probably better than ever.\n\n== Key Publications ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Inductive]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","'''Mixed Effect Models are built on a litany of preconditions, most of which most researchers choose to conveniently ignore.''' In my experience, this is more often than not ok, because it does not matter. Mixed Effect Models are - bless the maximum likelihood estimation - very sturdy. It is hard to find a model that does not have some predictive or explanatory value, even if hardly any pre-conditions are met. Still, this does not mean that we should ignore these. In order to sleep safe and sound at night, I am almost obsessed with model inspection, checking variance across levels, looking at the residuals, and looking for gaps and flaws in the model's fit. We should be really conservative to this end, because by focusing on fixed and random variance, we potentiate things that could go wrong. As I said, more often than not, this is not the case, but I propose to be super conservative when it comes to your model outcome. In order to get there, we need yet another thing: Model simplification.\n\nMixed Effect Models lead the forefront of statistics, and this might be the reason why the implementation of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) as a parsimony-based evaluation criterion is more abundant here when compared to other statistical approaches. P-values fell widely out of fashion in many branches of science, as did the reporting of full models. Instead, model reduction based on information criteria approaches is on the rise, reporting parsimonious models that honour [[Why_statistics_matters#Occam.27s_razor | Occam's razor]]. Starting with the maximum model, these approaches reduce the model until it is the minimum adequate model - in other words, the model that is as simple as possible, but as complex as necessary. The AIC is about the equivalent of a p-value of 0.12, depending on the sample size, hence beware that the main question may be the difference from the null model. In other words, a model that is better from the Null model, but only just so based on the AIC, may not be significant because the p-value would be around 0.12. This links to the next point: Explanatory power.\n\nThere has been some sort of a revival of r<sup>2<\/sup> values lately, mainly based on the suggestion of r<sup>2<\/sup> values that can be utilised for Mixed Effect Models. I deeply reject these approaches. First of all, Mixed Effect Models are not about how much the model explains, but whether the results are meaningfully different from the null model. I can understand that in a cancer study I would want to know how much my model may help people, hence an occasional glance of the fitted value against the original values may do no harm. However, r<sup>2<\/sup> in Mixed Effect Models is - to me - a step into the bad old days when we evaluated the worth of a model because of its ability to explain variance. This led to a lot of feeble discussions, of which I only mention here the debate on how good a model needs to be in terms of these values to be not bad, and vice versa. This is obviously a problem, and such normative judgements are a reason why statistics have such a bad reputation. Second, people are starting again to actually report their models based on the r<sup>2<\/sup>  value, and even have their model selection not independent of the r<sup>2<\/sup> value. This is something that should be bygone, yet it is not. '''Beware of the r<sup>2<\/sup> value, it is only deceiving you in Mixed Effect Models.''' Third, r<sup>2<\/sup> values in Mixed Effect Models are deeply problematic because they cannot take the complexity of the random variance into account. Hence, r<sup>2<\/sup> values in Mixed Effect Models make us go back to the other good old days, when mean values were ruling the outcomes of science. Today, we are closer to an understanding where variance matters, and why would we embrace that. Ok, it comes with a longer learning curve, but I think that the good old reduction to the mean was nothing but mean."],"36":["== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values.","The question of model reduction will preoccupy statistics for the next decades, and this development will be interacting with a further rise of Bayes theorem and other questions related to information processing. Time will tell how regressions will emerge on the other side, yet it is undeniable that there is a use case for this specific type of statistical model. Whether science will become better in terms of the theoretical foundations of regressions, in recognising and communicating the restrictions and flaws of regressions, and not overplaying their hand when it comes to the creation of knowledge, is an altogether different story. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n\n== References ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:R examples]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|authors]] of this entry are Henrik von Wehrden and Quentin Lehrer.","The last problem of regression analysis is the diversity of disciplinary norms and conventions when it comes to the reduction of complex models. '''Many regressions are multiple regressions, where the dependent variable is explained by many predictors (= independent variables).''' The interplay and single value of several predictors merits a model reduction approach, or alternatively a clear procedure in terms of model constructions. Different disciplines, but also smaller branches of sciences, differ vastly when it comes to these diversities, making the identification of the most parsimonious approach currently a challenge. \n\n== Simple linear regression in R ==\n\nAs mentioned before, R can be a powerful tool for visualising and analysing regressions. In this section we will look at a simple linear regression using \"forbes\" dataset.\n\nFirst of all we need to load all the packages. In this example, we will use the forbes dataset from the library MASS.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ninstall.packages(\"MASS\", repos = \"ttp:\/\/cran.us.r-project.org\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\n#Let's look closer at the dataset \n?forbes\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nWe can see that it is a dataframe with 17 observations corresponding to observed boiling point and corrected barometric pressure in the Alps. Let's arrange the dataset and convert it into a tibble in order to make it easier to analyze. It allows us to manipulate the dataset quickly (because the variables type is directly displayed).\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nforbes_df <- forbes   # We just rename the data\nforbes_tib <- as_tibble(forbes_df) # Convert the dataframe into a tibble\nhead(forbes_tib)     # Shows first 6 rows of dataset\n\n#Output:\n## # A tibble: 6 x 2\n##      bp  pres\n##   <dbl> <dbl>\n## 1  194.  20.8\n## 2  194.  20.8\n## 3  198.  22.4\n## 4  198.  22.7\n## 5  199.  23.2\n## 6  200.  23.4\n\nstr(forbes_tib)     # Structure of Prestige dataset\n\n#Output:\n## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    17 obs. of  2 variables:\n##  $ bp  : num  194 194 198 198 199 ...\n##  $ pres: num  20.8 20.8 22.4 22.7 23.1 ...\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is important to be sure that there is no missing value (\"NA\") to apply the linear regression. In case of the forbes dataset, which is basically small, we can see that there is no NA.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nsummary(forbes_tib)  # Summarize the data of forbes\n\n#Output:\n##        bp             pres      \n##  Min.   :194.3   Min.   :20.79  \n##  1st Qu.:199.4   1st Qu.:23.15  \n##  Median :201.3   Median :24.01  \n##  Mean   :203.0   Mean   :25.06  \n##  3rd Qu.:208.6   3rd Qu.:27.76  \n##  Max.   :212.2   Max.   :30.06\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn order to make it easier to understand for us, we are going to convert the two variables:\n1. the boiling temperature of the water (From Farenheit to Celcius). We will use the formula to convert a temperature from Farenheit to Celcius: C = 5\/9 x (F-32)\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nrequire(MASS)\nrequire(dplyr)\nFA <- forbes_tib %>%  # We define a table F that stands for the F in the above formula \n  dplyr::select(bp)  # and containing all the information concerning Temperatures\n\nTempCel <- ((5\/9) * (FA-32))\nTempCel"],"37":["The simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis. \n\nWithin inductive analysis it is less clear how to proceed best. Technically, one can only proceed based on AIC values. Again, there is a brute force approach that boils the maximum model down based on permutations of all combinations. However, this approach can be again considered to be statistical fishing, since no clear hypothesis are tested. While an AIC driven approach failsafes against the worst dangers of statistical fishing, it is clear that if you have no questions, then you also have no answers. Hence a purely inductive analysis does not really make sense, yet you can find the inner relations and main patterns of the dataset regardless of your approach, may it bee inductive or deductive. \n\nDeep down, any given dataset should reveal the same results based on this rigid analysis pathway and framework. However, the scientific community developed different approaches, and there are diverse schools of thinking, which ultimately leads to different approaches being out there. Different analysts may come up with different results. This exemplifies that statistics are not fully unleashed yet, but are indeed still evolving, and not necessarily about reproducible analysis. Keep that in mind when you read analysis, and be conservative in your own analysis. Keep no stone unturned, and go down any rabbit hole you can find.","== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures.

Search terms: 'Narrative Research', 'narrative inquiry', 'narrative analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n'''[[Glossary|Storytelling]] has been a way for humankind to express, convey, form and make sense of their reality for thousands of years''' (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000; Webster & Mertova 2007). 'Storytelling' is defined as the distinct tonality, format and presentation in which a story is told. The term 'narrative' includes both: the story itself, with its dramaturgy, characters and plot, as well as the act of storytelling (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). However, the term 'narrative' has been used used predominantly as a synonym for 'story' in academia for decades (Barrett & Stauffer 2009).\n\n'''Psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the notion of 'narrative' as being one of two forms of distinct modes of thinking in 1984''' - the other being the 'logico-scientific' mode (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). While the latter is \"(...) more concerned with establishing universal truth conditions\" (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.9), the 'narrative' mode represents the broad human experience of reality. This distinction led to further investigation on the idea that 'narratives' are a central form of human learning about - and [[Glossary|sense-making]] of - the world. Scholars began to recognize the role of analyzing narratives in order to understand individual and societal experiences and the meanings that are attached to these. This led e.g. to the establishment of the field of narrative psychology.\n\n'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.","'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.\n\nNarrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006). \n\nNarrative Research is \"(...) the study of stories\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus \"(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.\" (Moen 2006, p.56). The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014).\n\n'''One common approach in Narrative Research is the usage of narratives in form of spoken or written text or other types of media as the data material for analysis.''' This understanding is comparable to [[Content Analysis]] or [[Hermeneutics]]. A second understanding focuses on the creation of narratives as part of the methodological design, so that the narrative material is not pre-developed but emerges from the inquiry itself (Squire et al. 2014, Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000). In both approaches, 'narrative' is the underlying \"frame of reference\" (Moen 2006, p.57) for the research. An example for the latter understanding is the 'Narrative Interview'.\n\n==== Narrative Interviews ====\n[[File:Narrative Research Phases.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Basic phases of the narrative Interview.''' Source: Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.5.]]","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Narratives have their own inherent structure, formed by the narrating individual. Therefore, while narrative inquiry itself provides the benefits and challenges of a very open, reflexive and iterative research format, it is not non-structured, but gains structure by itself (see Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000)\n* Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) highlight that research methods that understand narratives as a mere format of data presented by the subject, which can then be analyzed just like other forms of content, neglect an important feature of narratives: Narrative Research \"(...) requires going beyond the use of narrative as rhetorical structure, to an analytic examination of the underlying insights and assumptions that the story illustrates\". Further, \"Narrative inquiry attempts to capture the 'whole story', whereas other methods tend to communicate understandings of studied subjects or phenomena at certain points, but frequently omit the important 'intervening' stages\" (ibid, p.3), with the latter being the context and cultural surrounding that is better understood when taking the whole narrative into account (see Moen 2006, p.59).\n* '''The insights gained through narratives are subjective to the narrator, which implies advantages and challenges.''' Compared to an 'objective' description of, e.g. a chain of events, the narration provides insights about the individual's interpretation and experience of the events, which may be inaccessible elsewhere, and shine light on complex social phenomena: \"Narrative is not an objective reconstruction of life - it is a rendition of how life is perceived.\" (Webster & Mertova 2007, p.3; see Moen 2006, p.62). However, this subjective representation of events or a situation may be distorted and differ from the 'real' world. Squire et al. (2014) refer to this distinction as different forms of 'truth' that researchers may be interested in: either representations of the physical world or of social realities which present the world through the lense of the narrator. Jovchelovitch & Bauer (2000, p.6) suggest that the researchers take both elements into consideration, first fully engaging with the subjective narrative, then comparing it to further information on the physical 'truth'. They should try \"(...) to render the narrative with utmost fidelity (in the first moment) and to organize additional information from different sources, to collate secondary material and to review literature or documentation about the event being investigated. Before we enter the field we need to be equipped with adequate materials to allow us to understand and make sense of the stories we gather.\" Moen (2006, p.63), by comparison, explains that \"(...) there is no static and everlasting truth\", anyway.\n* This [[Bias and Critical Thinking|conflict between different 'truths']] also has consequences for the quality criteria for Narrative Inquiry, especially for those research endeavors that create narratives themselves. To this end, 'usefulness' and 'persuasiveness' of the created narratives have been suggested as quality criteria (Barrett & Stauffer 2009) or, as Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) put it: \"Narrative research (...) does not strive to produce any conclusions of certainty, but aims for its findings to be 'well grounded' and 'supportable' (...) Narrative research does not claim to represent the exact 'truth', but rather aims for 'verisimilitude'\". (For more thoughts on validity in Narrative Inquiry, see Polkinghorne (2007)). For the analysis of narratives, a 'trustworthy' set of field notes and Interview data may serve as a measure of quality, which the researchers created through prolonged engagement in the field, triangulation of different data sources and the active search for disconfirmation of one's research results (see Moen 2006, p.64). Also, researchers \"(...) need to cogently argue that theirs is a viable interpretation grounded in the assembled texts\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.484).\n* Further challenges may arise during the active collaboration of the researcher in the field. For example, \"(...) the researcher and the research subjects interpret specific events in different ways or (...) the research subjects question the interpretive authority of the researcher\" (Moen 2006, p.62). Further comparable issues of qualitative field research are noted in the entry on [[Ethnography]]."],"39":["Over the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the patterns that are being modeled. '''In other words, GAMs are able to increase the model fit or predictive power, but in the worst case, we are throwing our means to understand or explain the existing relations out of the window.''' \n\nUnder this spell, over the last decades, parts of the statistical modelling wandered more strongly into the muddy waters of superior model fit, yet understood less and less about the underlying mechanisms. Modern science has to date not sufficiently engaged with the questions how predictive modelling can lead to optimific results, and which role our lack of explicit understanding play in terms of worse outcomes. Preventing a pandemic based on a predictive model is surely good, but enforcing a space shuttle start when there is some lack of understanding of the new conditions at launch day led to the Challenger disaster. '''Many disasters of human history were a lack of understanding the unexpected.''' When our experience was pushed into the new realms of the previously unknown, and our expactation of the likelihood of such an extreme event happening was low, the impending surprise often came at a high price. Many developments - global change, increasing system [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity,]] growing inequalities - may further decrease our ability to anticipate infrequent dynamics. This calls for a shift towards maximizing the resilience of our models that may be needed under future circumstances. While this has been highlighted i.e. by the IPCC, the Stockholm resilience center and many other institutions, policy makers are hardly prepared enough, which became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n== The world can (not) be predicted ==\nFrom a predictive or explanatory viewpoint, we can break the world of statistics down into three basic types of dynamics: Linear dynamics, periodical dynamics, and non-linear dynamics. Let us differentiate between these three.\n\n'''Linear dynamics''' are increasing or decreasing at an estimate that does not change over time. All linear relations have an endpoint which these patterns do not surpass. Otherwise there would be plants growing on the top of Mount Everest, diseases would spread indefinitely, and we could travel faster than the speed of light. All this is not the case, hence based on our current understanding, there are linear patterns, which at some point cannot increase. Until then, we can observe linear dynamics: you have a higher plant diversity and biomass under increasingly favourable growing conditions, illnesses may affect more and more people in a pandemic, and we can travel faster if we - simply spoken - invest more energy and wit into our travel vehicle. All these are current facts of reality that were broken down by humans into linear patterns and mechanisms. \n\n'''Periodical dynamics''' are recognized by humans since the beginning of time itself. Within seasonal environments, plants grow in spring and summer, diseases show increases and decreases that show up-and-down patterns, and travel vehicles do not maintain their speed because of friction or gravity. Hence we can understand and interpret many of the linear phenomena we observe as cyclic or periodical phenomena as well. Many of the laws and principles that are at the basis of our understanding are well able to understand such periodic fluctuations, and the same statistics that can catch linearly increasing or decreasing phenomena are equally enabling us to predict or even understand such periodic phenomena.","[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page.\n\nIn addition, GLMs are often a part of very specific parts of science. Whether researchers implement GLMs or not is often depending on their education: it is not guaranteed that everybody is aware of their necessity and able to implement these advanced models. What makes this even more challenging is that within larger analyses, different parts of the dataset may be built upon different distributions, and it can be seen as inconvenient to report diverse GLMs that are based on different distributions, particularly because these are then utilising different evaluative criteria. The ideal world of a statistician may differ from the world of a researcher using these models, showcasing that GLMs cannot be taken for granted as of yet. Often, researchers still prioritise to follow disciplinary norms rather than go for comparability and coherence. Hence the main weakness of GLMs is a failure or flaw in the application of the model, which can be due to a lack of experience. This is especially concerning in GLMs, since such mistakes are more easily made than identified."],"40":["6. Poisson Limit Theorem states that Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, under certain conditions. When the value of n (number of trials) in a binomial distribution is large and the value of p (probability of success) is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution i.e., n -> \u221e and \u03bb = np, rate parameter, \u03bb is defined as the number of trials, n, in binomial distribution multiplied by the probability of success, p.\n\n7. A Poisson distribution with a high mean \u03bb > 20 can be approximated as a normal distribution. However, as normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution, a continuity correction is necessary. It would exceed the scope to discuss in detail here what this correction is. In short, it adds or substracts 0.5 to the value in question to increase the accuracy of the estimation when using a continuous probability approach for something that has discrete probabilities.\nFor example, a factory with 45 accidents per year follows a Poisson distribution. A normal approximation would suggest that the probability of more than 50 accidents can be computed as follows:\n\nMean = \u03bb = \u03bc =45\n\nStandard deviation = \u2202 = \u221a\u03bb = 6.71 P(X>50.5) -> after continuity correction =\n[[File:6 equation.PNG|center]]\nusing Z score table, see more [https:\/\/builtin.com\/data-science\/how-to-use-a-z-table here].\n\n==5.

You can also see that the data is slightly skewed to the right since there is a larger variance to the right than to the left. Looking at the distribution, it looks fairly normally distributed. However, the low lambda does not allow to use the Poisson distribution as an approximation for a normal distribution. Most probably, the large dataset allows us to see it as a normal distribution, since most distributions converge to a normal distribution with increasing sample size.\n==6.

Introduction to Probability Distribution==\nA probability distribution summarizes the probabilities for the values of a random variable. The general properties\/features that define a distribution include the four mathematical moments: \n\n1.\t'''Expected value E(X)''': This is the outcome with the highest probability or likelihood or an average or mean value for the variable X.\n \n2.\t'''Variance Var(X)''': Variance denotes the spread of the values from the expected value. The standard deviation is the normalized value of variance obtained by taking a square root of the variance. The covariance summarizes the linear relationship for how the two variables change with respect to each other. \n\n3.\t'''Skewness''': Skewness is the measure of asymmetry of a random variable X about the mean E(X) of a probability distribution. It can be positive (tail on the right side), negative (tail on left side), zero (balanced tail on both sides) or undefined. Zero skewness does not always mean symmetric distribution as one tail can be long and thin and the other can be short and fat. \na\n4.\t'''Kurtosis''': Kurtosis is the measure of \u2018 *peaked-ness* \u2019 of distribution. It can be differentiating tool between distributions that have the same mean and variance. Higher kurtosis means a peak and fatter\/extended tails. \n\nEach random variable has its own probability distribution that may have a similar shape to other variables, however, the structure will differ based on whether the variable is discrete or continuous, since probability distributions of continuous variables have an infinite number of values and probability functions of discrete variables assign a probability to each concrete data point. \n\n==2. Poisson Distribution==\nPoisson Distribution is one of the discrete probability distributions along with binomial, hypergeometric, and geometric distributions. The following table differentiates what applies where.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Distribution !! Definition\n|-\n| Binomial || It is used when there are two possible outcomes (success\/failure) in a process that are independent of each other in n number of trials. The easiest example is a coin toss whereas a more practical use of binomial distribution is testing a drug, whether the drug cures the disease or not in n number of trials\n|-\n| Hypergeometric || It calculates the number of k successes in n number of trials where the probability of success changes with each passing trial. This kind of distribution applies in Poker when drawing a red card from the deck changes the probability of drawing another red card after it.\n|-\n| Poisson || It provides the probability of an event happening a certain number of times (k) within a given interval of time or space. For example, figuring out the probability of disease occurrence m times in the next month given that it occurs n times in 1 year.\n|-\n| Geometric || It determines the number of independent trials needed to get the first successful outcome. Geometric distribution may be used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a certain decision in a business.\n|}\n\nPoisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

One person or a group comes up with ideas, then envisions their implementation and finally reflects upon their feasibility in a circular process. The Disney Method may be used to come up with ideas for projects or products, to solve problems and conflicts, to develop strategies and to make decisions. The method was invented by Walt Disney who thought of a movie not only as a director, but also as an audience member and a producer to come up with the best possible result.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Productive brainstorming\n* Understanding for other perspectives\n* Strong team spirit \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe Disney method process is circular. A group of people (ideally five or six) is split into three different roles: the Dreamers, the Realists, the Critics. \n\n[[File:Disney Method.png|450px|thumb|right|The Disney Method process]]\n\nThe '''Dreamers'''...\n* try to come up with new ideas\n* are creative and imaginative and do not set themselves any limits\n* everything is possible!\n* Guiding questions: ''Which ideas come to mind? What would be an ideal solution to the problem?''\n\nThe '''Realists'''...\n* think about what needs to be done to implement the ideas\n* are practical and realistic\n* Guiding Questions: ''How does the idea feel? How could it be implemented? Who should do it and at what cost?''\n\nThe '''Critics'''...\n* look at the idea objectively and try to identify crucial mistakes\n* are critical, but constructive - they do not want to destroy the ideas, but improve them constructively.\n* Guiding Questions: ''What was neglected by the Dreamers and Realists? What can be improved, what will not work? Which risks exist?''\n\nEach role receives a specific area within a room, or even dedicated rooms or locations, that may also be decorated according to the respective role. '''The process starts with the Dreamers, who then pass on their ideas to the Realists, who pass their thoughts on to the Critics.''' Each phase should be approx. 20 minutes long, and each phase is equivalently important. \nAfter one cycle, the Critics pass back the feedback to the ideas to the Dreamers, who continue thinking about new solutions based on the feedback they got. Every participant should switch the role throughout the process (with short breaks to 'neutralize' their minds) in order to understand the other roles' perspectives. The process goes on for as long as it takes, until the Dreamers are happy about the ideas, the Realists are confident about their feasibility and the Critics do not have any more remarks.\n\nA fourth role (the neutral moderator) may be added if the process demands it. He\/she is then responsible for starting and ending the process and moderating the discussions.

In many cases, if around 80% of the variance can be explained by the first k PCs, we can discard the other (d - k) PCs. Of course, this is only one of the heuristics method to determine k.  You can also use thr elbow method (the scree plot) like in k-means.\n\n==== Summary ====\n* PCA is a feature extraction technique widely used to reduce dimensionality of datasets.\n* PCA works by calculating the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the initial variables in the data. These are the principle components. Number of PCs = number of eigenvectors = number of features.\n* The PCs are ranked by the eigenvalues, and iteratively show the directions in which the data spreads the most (after accounting for the previous PCs).\n* We can choose to keep a few of the first PCs that cummulatively explains the data well enough, and these are the new reduced dimension of the data.\n* Standardization is a crucial step in data pre-processing to ensure the validity of the PCA results.\n\n\n=== R Example ===\nGoing back to the example in the introduction, the dataset can be found here: https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/sdhilip\/nutrient-analysis-of-pizzas\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Loading library\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For pre-processing data\nlibrary(factoextra) # For visualization\ntheme_set(theme_bw()) # Set theme for plots\n\n# Load data\ndata <- read_csv(\"Pizza.csv\")\nhead(data)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nAs shown here, there are seven measurements of nutrients for each pizza. Our goal is to reduce these seven dimensions of information down to only two, so that we can present the main patterns in our data on a flat piece of paper.\n\nTo conduct Principle Component Analysis in R, we use <code>prcomp<\/code>. From the original data, we only select the seven nutrient measurements as input for the function. In this function, we set <code>scale = TRUE<\/code> to perform scaling and centering (so that all variables will have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1). The result object is saved in <code>data.pca<\/code>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata.pca <- prcomp(data[, mois:cal]), scale = TRUE)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we can visualize and inspect the result of the analysis. We start off by looking at the contribution of each created principle component (PC) to the overall variance in the dataset. For this, we create a spree plot:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfviz_eig(data.pca)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File: PCA_ScreePlot.png|center|500px]]\n\nLike I mentioned before, the number of PC created is equal to the number of input variables (in this cases, seven). Looking at the plot, the first two PCs combined can explain more than 90% of the dataset, an amazing number. This means this 7-dimensional dataset can be presented on a 2-dimensional space, and we still only lose less than 10% of the information. In other words, the first two PCs are the most important, and we can discard the other ones.\n\nNext, we look at the contribution of the original variables to the building of the two PCs, respectively.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfviz_contrib(data.pca, choice = \"var\", axes = 1)\nfviz_contrib(data.pca, choice = \"var\", axes = 2)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File: PCA_ContribPlot.png|center|500px]]\n\nThe red, dashed line refers to the case where all of the variable contribute equally. In the left plot, ash, fat, sodium and carbohydrates contribute substantially to the forming of the first PC. On the other hand, moisture and calories influence the second PC heavily, as seen in the right plot.\n\nFinally, we look at the biplot of the analysis. This reveals the underlying patterns of the dataset:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfviz_pca_biplot(data.pca, label = \"var\", habillage = data$brand, axes = c(1,2), addEllipse = TRUE)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File: PCA_BiPlot.png|center|500px]]","The question of model reduction will preoccupy statistics for the next decades, and this development will be interacting with a further rise of Bayes theorem and other questions related to information processing. Time will tell how regressions will emerge on the other side, yet it is undeniable that there is a use case for this specific type of statistical model. Whether science will become better in terms of the theoretical foundations of regressions, in recognising and communicating the restrictions and flaws of regressions, and not overplaying their hand when it comes to the creation of knowledge, is an altogether different story. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n\n== References ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:R examples]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|authors]] of this entry are Henrik von Wehrden and Quentin Lehrer.","* Jolliffe, I.

Looking at the relationship between exam and points, no clear pattern can be identified. Therefore, it cannot be safely assumed, that a heteroscedastic dispersion is given.\n[[File:Pic 1.png|700px]]\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"group\", diag_kind=\"hist\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored in the final written exam, for the exercises and number of solved questions solved among the learning groups A,B and C.\n\n[[File:Pic 2.png|700px]]\n\nThe histograms among the diagonal line from top left to bottom right show no normal distribution. The histogram for id can be ignored since it does not provide any information about the student records. Looking at the relationship between exam and points, a slight pattern could be identified that would hint to heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\n===Correlations with Heatmap===\nA heatmap shows the correlation between different variables. Along the diagonal line from left to right, there is perfect positive correlation because it is the correlation of one variable against itself. Generally, you can assess the heatmap fully visually, since the darker the square, the stronger the correlation.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\np=sns.heatmap(data.corr(),\n              annot=True, cmap='PuBu');\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:Pic 3.png]]\n\nThe results of the heatmap are quite surprising. There is no positive correlation between any activity prior to the exam and the exam points scored. In fact, a negative correlation between quanti and exam of -0.21 is considerably large. If this is confirmed in the OLS, one explanation could be that the students lacked time to study for the exam because of the number of exercises solved. The only positive, albeit not too strong correlation can be found between points and quanti. This positive relationship seems intuitive considering that with an increased number of exercises solved, the total of points that can be achieved increases and the students will generally have more total points.\n\n==OLS==\nNow, we will have a look at different OLS approaches. We will test for heteroscedasticity formally in each model with the Breusch-Pagan test.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nmodel_1 = smf.ols(formula='points ~ ID + quanti', data=data) ## defines the first model with points being the dependent and id and quanti being the independendet variable\nresult_bp1 = model_1.fit()\n\n# Checking for heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test\nbp1_test = het_breuschpagan(result_bp1.resid, result_bp1.model.exog)\n\n# Print the Breusch-Pagan test p-value\nprint(\"Breusch-Pagan test p-value:\", bp1_test[1])\n\n## If the p value is smaller then the set limit (e.g., 0.05, we need to reject the assumption of homoscedasticity and assume heteroscedasticity).\n\nresult = model_1.fit() ## estimates the regression\n\nprint(result.summary()) ## print the result\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:new_attempt.png]]\n\nLooking at the Breusch-Pagan test, we can see that we cannot reject the assumption of homoscedasticity. \nConsidering the correlation coefficients, no statistically significant relationship can be identified. The positive relationship between quanti and points can be found again, but it is not statistically significant.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfrom statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan\n\nmodel_2 = smf.ols(formula='points ~ ID + sex', data=data)\nresult_bp2 = model_2.fit()\n\n# Checking for heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test\nbp2_test = het_breuschpagan(result_bp2.resid, result_bp2.model.exog)\n\n# Print the Breusch-Pagan test p-value\nprint(\"Breusch-Pagan test p-value:\", bp2_test[1])\n\n# Set the value for maxlags\nmaxlags = 25  # Update this value as needed","#Now we can for example test, if the difference in sepal length between setosa and virginica is significant:\n#H0 hypothesis: The medians (distributions) of setosa and virginica are equal\n#H1 hypothesis: The medians (distributions) of setosa and virginica differ\n\n#test for normality\nshapiro.test(setosa$Sepal.Length)\nshapiro.test(virginica$Sepal.Length)\n#both are normally distributed\n\n#wilcoxon sum of ranks test\nwilcox.test(setosa$Sepal.Length,virginica$Sepal.Length)\n\n#the p-value is 2.2e-16, which is below 0.05 (it's almost 0). \n#Therefore we neglect the H0 Hypothesis and adopt the H1 Hypothesis.\n#Based on this result we may conclude the medians of these two distributions differ. \n#The alternative hypothesis is stated as the \u201ctrue location shift is not equal to 0\u201d. \n#That\u2019s another way of saying \u201cthe distribution of one population is shifted to the left or \n#right of the other,\u201d which implies different medians. \n\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n|}\n\n\n====f-test====\n'''The f-test allows you to compare the ''variance'' of two samples.''' Variance is calculated by taking the average of squared deviations from the mean and tells you the degree of spread in your data set. The more spread the data, the larger the variance is in relation to the mean. If the p-value of the f-test is lower than 0,05, the variances differ significantly. Important: for the f-Test, the data of the samples has to be normally distributed. \n\n'''Example''': If you examine players in a basketball and a hockey team, you would expect their heights to be different on average. But maybe the variance is not. Consider Figure 1 where the mean is different, but the variance the same - this could be the case for your hockey and basketball team. In contrast, the height could be distributed as shown in Figure 2. The f-test then would probably yield a p-value below 0,05.\n\n[[File:Normal distribution.jpg|400px|thumb|left|Figure 1 shows '''two datasets which are normally distributed, but shifted.'''

However, looking at the number of females in the dataset, we need to be very cautious to draw any conclusions. Since there are only four females in the dataset (and 73 males), the sample size is considered too small to make any statements about gendered effects on total points achieved.

First, the data needs to be prepared, for example the Nas need to be removed. Then, the data needs to be assessed visually, to gain an understanding of potential homo- or heteroscedasticity. Finally, after testing for heteroscedasticity, the regression can be run, albeit the results always need to be considered in light of the available data, such as with the case for the effect of gender on total points achieved.\n\n==References==\n1.Iqbal H.(2020),Linear Regression Analysis, Source:https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets\/iqbalrony\/linear-regression-analysis , Accessed: 20.12.2022\n\n2.Dheeraja V.(2022),Heteroskedasticity,Source :https:\/\/www.wallstreetmojo.com\/heteroskedasticity\/ ,Accessed:20.12.2022\n\n3.Econometrics(2022),Introduction to Econometrics with R ,Source :https:\/\/www.econometrics-with-r.org\/5-4-hah.html , Accessed view:24.12.2022\n\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:Python basics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is XX.

The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were \"(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]\" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).\n\n'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2). \n\nToday, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.","They received feedback to these scenario drafts in a second round of workshops. Then, they used existent data on social-ecological trends in the region and rated how these trends might develop under each scenario, resulting in '''scenario maps,''' which provide a better idea of how the region would change under each scenario. \n<br>\n[[File:Scenario Planning - Exemplary study - Hanspach et al. 2014 - Scenario Maps.png|750px|thumb|center|'''Scenario maps created for Southern Transylvania.''' Each map shows how a specific social-ecological trend (three out of eight are shown) develop under one of the four scenarios. Red = likely, blue = unlikely.

It also becomes clear how this method can facilitate policy responses and how scenarios are a helpful form of communicating scientific data.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\nWack, P. 1985.

These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them \"(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all \"fundamentally different\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios \"(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).\n\n'''There is no ''one'' procedure for Scenario Planning''' (5). A commonly cited approach by Schoemaker (2, 3) includes the following steps:<br>\n1) Definition of time frame, scope, decision variables and major actors of the issue in question.\n\n2) Identification of current trends and predetermined elements and how they influence the defined decision variables, based on the knowledge of experts and the available data. It should be observed whether major trends are compatible with each other and which uncertainties exist. \n\n3) Construction of extreme future states along a specific continuum (positive vs negative, probable vs surprising, continuous vs divergent etc.) for all the elements or variables. These extremes are then assessed for their internal consistency and plausibility in terms of stakeholder decisions, trends and outcomes.\n\n4) Elimination of implausible or impossible futures and, based on the themes that emerged from these, the creation of new scenarios. This process is repeatedly done until internally consistent scenarios are found. The number of scenarios developed depends on the scope and purpose of the planning process (1, 5).\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Process.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Evaluation of the number of scenarios developed.''' Source: Amer et al. 2013. p.33]]\n\n5) The preliminary scenarios are analysed in terms of which decisions would need to be taken by the key stakeholders to reach them, and potentially revised again when further investigation of these scenarios brings up additional or contradictory knowledge about them. The scenarios may also be transferred into quantitative models to learn about the development and inherent uncertainties of individual variables.\n\n6) Finally, these preliminary scenarios are re-iterated by going through the previous steps again, checking for their applicability to the issue at hand, until finally, scenarios emerge that can be used for planning processes.\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Example.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Exemplary scenarios for life in Australian cities.''' Source: Gaziulusoy & Ryan 2017, p.1920]]\n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Scenario Planning allows for any organization that deploys it to be more innovative, flexible and thus better prepared for unforeseen disruptions and changes. In a corporate context, this can reduce costs, provide market benefits and improve internal communication (3, 5).\n* Scenario Planning broadens the structural perspective of an actor to think about the future (5). For example, an oil company may well be able to assess risks in their technical processes of oil exploration and extraction, but only through a more detailed scenario analysis they may be enabled to include economic, political and societal trends into their planning (2).\n* Scenarios are psychologically attractive. They are a way of transforming seemingly disparate data into relatable, coherent narratives. They present uncertainty across scenarios instead of providing probabilistic information for all elements within each individual one. In addition, they reduce the complexity and uncertainty of the future into graspable states (2).\n* Scenario Planning differs from adjacent methodological approaches. While a ''scenario'' illustrates a possible state of the future, a ''vision'' (see [[Visioning & Backcasting]] revolves around a desirable state of the future without taking its likelihood into consideration. Compared to Visioning, Scenario Planning might therefore be more useful for actual [[Glossary|decision-making]] but might as well be too narrow to envision holistic systemic changes (6). Additionally, a ''prediction'' as the classical method of economic ''forecasting'' describes likely states of the future as an extension of current developments, without the openness for [[Glossary|change]] that is inherent to Scenario Planning."],"45":["[[File:ConceptSocialNetworkAnalysis.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Social Network Analysis]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n|'''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || [[:Category:Future|Future]]\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/>\n\n'''In short:''' Social Network Analysis visualises social interactions as a network and analyzes the quality and quantity of connections and structures within this network.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Scopus Results Social Network Analysis.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Social Network Analysis until 2019.''' Search terms: 'Social Network Analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\n'''One of the originators of Network Analysis was German philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel'''. His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued \"against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|'''Moreno's original work on Social Networks.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]\n\nRomanian-American psychosociologist '''Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s''' with his - and his collaborator Helen Jennings' - 'sociometry', which served \"(...) as a way of conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction.\" (Scott 1988, p.110). Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).\n\nMoreno's and Jennings' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of ''''group dynamics', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.''' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.","== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.894]]\n\nThe Social Network Analyst then analyzes these relations \"(...) for structural patterns that emerge among these actors. Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3). Surrounding actors may provide leverage or influence that affect the agent's actions (Borgatti et al. 2009)","==== Step by Step ====\n* '''Type of Network:''' First, Social Network Analysts decide whether they intend to focus on a holistic view on the network (''whole networks''), or focus on the network surrounding a specific node of interest (''ego networks''). They also decide for either ''one-mode networks'', focusing on one type of node that could be connected with any other; or ''two-mode networks'' where there are two types of nodes, with each node unable to be connected with another node of the same type (Marin & Wellman 2010, 13). For a two-mode network, you could imagine an analysis of social events and the individuals that visit these, where each event is not connected to another event, but only to other individuals; and vice-versa.\n* '''Network boundaries:''' In a next step, the approach to defining nodes needs to be chosen. Three ways of defining networks can be named according to Marin & Wellman (2010, p.2, referring to Laumann et al. (1983)). These three are approaches not mutually exclusive and may be combined:\n** ''position-based approach'': considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally-defined positions to be network members, and all others would be excluded\n** ''event-based'' approach: those who had participated in key events are believed to define the population\n** ''relation-based approach'': begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.\n** Butts (2008) adds the ''exogenously defined boundaries'', which are pre-determined based on the research intent or theory which provide clearly specified entities of interest.\n* '''Type of ties:''' Then, the researcher needs to decide on which kinds of ties to focus. There can be two forms of ties between network nodes: ''directed'' ties, which go from one node to another, and ''undirected ties'', that connect two nodes without any distinct direction. Both types can either be [[Data formats|binary]] (they exist, or do not exist), or valued (they can be stronger or weaker than other ties): As an example, \"(..) a friendship network can be represented using binary ties that indicate if two people are friends, or using valued ties that assign higher or lower scores based on how close people feel to one another, or how often they interact.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14; Borgatti et al. 2009)\n* '''Data Collection''': When the research focus is chosen, the data necessary for Social Network Analysis can be gathered in [[Survey Research|Surveys]] or [[Interviews]], through [[Ethnography|Observation]], [[Content Analysis]] (typically literature-based) or similar forms of data gathering. Surveys and Interviews are most common, with the researchers asking individuals about the existence and strength of connections between themselves and others actors, or within other actors excluding themselves (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14). There are two common approaches when surveying individuals about their own connections to others: In a ''prompted recall'' approach, they are asked which people they would think of with regards to a specific topic (e.g. \"To whom would you go for advice at work?\") while they are shown a pre-determined list of potentially relevant individuals. In the ''free list'' approach, they are asked to recall individuals without seeing a list (Butts 2008, p.20f).\n* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape."],"46":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Stacked Area plots. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nThis entry aims to introduce Stacked Area Plot and its visualization using R\u2019s <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot2<\/syntaxhighlight> package. A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

This entry helps visualise two different types of stacked bar plots, ''Simple Stacked Plots'' and ''Proportions Stacked Plots'', and explains the difference between them. For more on the basics of barplots, please refer to the [[Barplots, Histograms and Boxplots]] entry.\n\n\n==Stacked Barplots: Proportions vs. Absolute Values==\nStacked bar plots show the quantitative relationship that exists between a main category and its subcategories. Each bar represents a principal category and it is divided into segments representing subcategories of a second categorical variable. The chart shows not only the quantitative relationship between the different subcategories with each other but also with the main category as a whole. They are also used to show how the composition of the subcategories changes over time.\n\nStacked bar plots should be used for Comparisons and Proportions but with emphasis on Composition. This composition analysis can be static for a certain moment in time, or dynamic for a determined period of time.\n\nStacked bar Plots are two-dimensional with two axes: one axis shows categories, the other axis shows numerical values. The axis where the categories are indicated does not have a scale (*) to highlight that it refers to discrete (mutually exclusive) groups. The axis with numerical values must have a scale with its corresponding measurements units.\n\n\n===When you should use a stacked bar plot===\nThe main objective of a standard bar chart is to compare numeric values between levels of a categorical variable. One bar is plotted for each level of the categorical variable, each bar\u2019s length indicating numeric value. A stacked bar chart also achieves this objective, but also targets a second goal.\n\nWe want to move to a stacked bar chart when we care about the relative decomposition of each primary bar based on the levels of a second categorical variable. Each bar is now comprised of a number of sub-bars, each one corresponding with a level of a secondary categorical variable. The total length of each stacked bar is the same as before, but now we can see how the secondary groups contributed to that total.\n\n\n==Two types of Stacked Barplots==\n1. '''Simple Stacked Plots'''\u00a0place the\u00a0'''absolute value'''\u00a0of each subcategory after or over the previous one. The numerical axis has a scale of numerical values. The graph shows the absolute value of each subcategory and the sum of these values indicates the total for the category. Usually, the principal bars have different final heights or lengths.\n   \nWe use simple stacked plots when relative and absolute differences matter.

'''Proportions Stacked Plots''' place the '''percentage''' of each subcategory after or over the previous one. The numerical axis has a scale of percentage figures. The graph shows the percentage of each segment referred to the total of the category. All the principal bars have the same height.\n\nIn proportions stacked plots the emphasis is on the percentage composition of each subcategory since the totals by category are not shown; in other words, they are used when the key message is the percentage of composition and not the total within the categories. We use proportions stacked plots only when relative differences matter."],"47":["All this exemplifies that Thought Experiments are deeply normative, and show a great flexibility in terms of the methodological design setup in space and time. Some of the most famous Thought Experiments (such as the [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Teletransportation_paradox tele-transportation paradox]) are quite unconnected from our realities, yet still they are. This is the great freedom of Thought Experiments, as they help us to understand something basically about ourselves. '''Thought Experiments can be a deeply transformational methods, and can enable us to learn the most about ourselves, our choices, and our decisions.'''\n\n== Strengths and Challenges ==\nThe core strengths of Thought Experiments is to raise normative assumptions of about the world, and about the future. Thought Experiments can thus unleash a transformative potential within individuals, as people question the status quo in their norms and morals. Another strength of Thought Experiments is the possibility to consider different futures, as well as alternatives of the past. Thought Experiments are thus as versatile and flexible as people's actions or decision, and the ''What if'' of Thought Experiments allows us to re-design our world and make deep inquiries into alternative state of the world. This makes Thought Experiments potentially time-saving, and also resource-efficient. If we do not need to test our assumptions in the real world, our work may become more efficient, and we may even be able to test assumptions that would be unethical in the real world. '''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat experiment is purely theoretical, and thus not only important for physics, but also better for the cat.''' This latest strength is equally also the greatest weakness of Thought Experiments. We might consider all different option about alternative states of the world, yet we have to acknowledge that humankind has a long history of being wrong in terms of our assumptions about the world. In other words, while Thought Experiments are so fantastic because they can be unburdened by reality, this automatically means that they are also potentially different from reality. Another potential flaw of Thought Experiments is that they are only as good as our assumptions and reflections about the world. A four-year-old making up theThought Experiment \"What if I have an unlimited amount of ice cream?\" would consequently drown or freeze in the unlimited amount of ice cream. Four-year-olds are not aware of the danger of the \"unlimited\", and may not be the best Thought Experimenters. The same holds true for many other people, and just as our norms and values change, the value of specific Thought Experiments can change over time. Thought Experiments are like a reflection, and any reflection can be blurry, partly, bended, or plain wrong - the last case, if we cannot identify our reflection in the mirror of Thought Experiments.\n\n== Normativity ==\nThought experiments are as we have already learned as normative as are our assumptions about the world. Hume argued that Thought Experiments are based on the laws of nature, yet here I would disagree. While many famous Thought Experiments are about the physical world, others are only made up in our minds. Many Thought Experiments are downright impossible to be matched with our reality, and are even explicitly designed to do this, such as Thomas Nagels Encyclopaedia of the Universe. It is therefore important to realise that basically all Thought Experiments are in essence normative, and one could say even downright subjective. Building on Derek Parfit, I would however propose a different interpretation, and propose that we should not measure the normativity of Thought Experiments through the design and setting, but instead by their outcome. Many people might come to the same conclusions within a given Thought Experiment, and some conclusion drawn from Thought Experiments may matter more than others. Consequently the penultimate question - also for Derek Parfit - is whether there are some Thought Experiments that are not normative. \n\n== Outlook ==\nMuch of [[Glossary|art]] and the media can be seen as a Thought Experiment, and there are ample examples that Thought Experiments in the media and the arts triggered or supported severe societal transformations. Thought Experiments are of equal importance in ethics and physics, and the bridge-building of the methodological approach should not be overestimated. Examples from the past prove that Thought Experiments can enable a great epistemological flexibility and diversity. This flexibility is even so large that Thought Experiments serve as a bridge between the epistemological and the ontological, or in other words between everything we know - and how we know it - and everything we believe. By enabling the transformation of our own most individual thoughts, Thought Experiments may provide a boat or a bridge to link the metaphysical with the world of knowledge.\n\n== Key Publications ==\nParfit, D.

Search term: 'thought experiment' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\n'''The Thought Experiment may well be the oldest scientific method.''' The consideration of potential futures was a vital step when our distant ancestors emancipated themselves and became humans. Asking themselves the ''What if'' questions was a vital step in the dawn of humankind, and both in the West and the East many of the first thinkers are known to have engaged in Thought Experiments. Methodologically, Thought Experiments provide a link between the metaphysical - or philosophy - and the natural world - i.e. natural sciences. Ancient Greece as well as Buddhism and Hinduism are full of early examples of Thought Experiments. Aristoteles remains a first vital step in the West, and after a long but slow growth of the importance of the methods, he represents a bridge into the early [[History of Methods|enlightenment]]. Galileo and Newton are early examples of famous Thought Experiments that connect theoretical considerations with a systematic reflection of the natural world. This generation of more generalisable laws was more transgressed with the ''Origin of Species'' by Charles Darwin. This theory was initially one epic Thought Experiment, and although DNA initially confirmed it, the role of epigenetics was another step that proved rather problematic for Darwinism. Mach introduced the term \"Thought Experiment\", and Lichtenberg created a more systematic exploration of thought experiments. Many ethical Thought Experiments gained province in the 20st century, and Derek Parfit is a prominent example how these experiments are used to illustrate and argument cases and examples within ethics.\n\n== What the method does ==\nThought Experiments are the philosophical method that asks the \"What if\" questions in a systematic sense. Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word \"experiment\" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.","The easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a \"What if\" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers of variations of this experiment exist (see Further Information), as it can teach much about choice, ethics, and responsibility. For instance, many people would change the train direction, but hardly anyone would push a person onto the track to derail the train. This would save the other five, and the outcome would be the same. However the difference between pushing a lever or pushing a person has deep psychological ramifications that resolve around guilt. This exemplifies that the Thought Experiment does not necessarily have a ''best'' outcome, as the outcome depends - in this example - on your moral choices. Some might argue that you should hurl yourself onto the track to stop the train, thereby not changing the countable outcome, but performing a deeply altruistic act that saves everybody else. Most people would probably be unable to do this. \n\n'''Such deeply normative Thought Experiments differ from Thought Experiments that resolve around the natural world.''' Dropping a feather and a stone from a high building is such an example, as this experiment is clearly not normative. We are all aware that the air would prevent the feather to fall as fast as the stone. What if we take the air now out of the experiment, and let both fall in a vacuum. Such a Thought Experiment is prominent in physics and exemplifies the great flexibility of this method. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat was another example of the Thought Experiment, where quantum states and uncertainty are illustrated by a cat that is either dead or not, which depends on the decay of some radioactive element. Since radioactive decay rates are not continuous, but represent a sudden change, the cat could be dead or not. The cat is dead and not dead at the same time. Many argue that this is a paradox, and I would follow this assumption with the supporting argument that we basically look at two realities at the same time. This exemplifies again that our interpretation of this Thought Experiment can also be normative, since a definitive proof of my interpretation is very difficult. This is insofar relevant, as seemingly all Thought Experiments are still based on subjective realisations and inferences. \n\n[[File:Schr\u00f6dingers Cat.png|400px|thumb|left|'''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.''' Source: [https:\/\/ad4group.com\/schrodingers-cat-and-the-marketing-strategy\/ AD4Group].]]\n\nSo far, we see that there are Thought Experiments that resolve exclusively about a - subjective - human decision, and other types of Thought Experiments that are designed around setting in the physical world. The difference between these two is in the design of the experiment itself, as the first are always focused on the normative decisions or people, while the second focuses on our normative interpretation of anticipation of a design that is without a human influence. This distinction is already helpful, yet another dimension is about time. Many Thought Experiments are independent of time, while others try to reinterpret the past to make assumptions about a future about which we have no experience. Thought Experiments that focus on re-interpretation of the past (\"What if the assassination of Franz Ferdinands failed? Would the first World War still have happened?\") look for alternative pathways of history, often to understand the historical context and - more impotantly - the consequences of this context better. Most Thought Experiments are independent of a longer time scale. These experiments - such as the Trolley experiment - look at a very close future, and are often either very constructed or lack a connection to a specific context. Thought Experiments that focus on the future are often build around utopian or at least currently unthinkable examples that question the status quo, either form an ethical, societal, cultural or any other perspective. Such desirable futures are deeply normative yet can build an important bridge to our current reality through backcasting (\"What if there is no more poverty, and how can we achieve this?\")."],"48":["The autocorrelation largely ranges between -0.2 and 0.2 and is considered to be a weak autocorrelation and can be neglected.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports necessary functions to create a plot\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf ## imports functions to calculate the confidence intervals (the so-called autocorrelation function)\n\nfig = plot_acf(df['usage_kwh'], alpha=.05, lags=24*4*2) ## creates a plot for the autocorrelation function of the electricity usage for two days (24*4 measurements per day (4 per hour) times 2)\nlabel_range = np.arange(0, len(steps), 24*2) ## sets the range for the  days of the label\nplt.xticks(ticks=label_range, labels=[x*15\/60 for x in label_range]) ## determines the number of ticks on x axis\nplt.xlabel('Lag (hours)') ## title x axis\nplt.ylabel('Autocorrelation of electricity usage with confidence interval') ## title y axis\nplt.title('') ## no plot title\nplt.ylim((-.25, 1.)) ## sets the limit of the y axis\nfig.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:ACF conf.png|700px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 6: Autocorrelation of electricity usage over two days<\/small>\n\nValues in the shaded region are statistically not significant, so there is a chance higher than 5% that there is no autocorrelation.\n\n===Detecting and Replacing Outliers===\nIn time series data, there are often outliers skewing the distributions, trends, or periodicity. There are multiple approaches to detecting and dealing with outliers in time series data. We will have a look at detecting outliers first: 1. Distribution-based outlier detection: This detection method relies on the assumption that the data follows a certain known distribution. Then all points outside this distribution are considered outliers. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 2. Distance-based outlier detection: This method computes the distance from one point to all other points. A point is considered \u201cclose\u201d to another point when the distance between them is below a set threshold. Then, a point is considered an outlier if the fraction of points deemed close to that point is below a threshold. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 3. Local outlier factor (LOF): The local outlier factor (LOF) is a measure of how anomalous an object is within a dataset, based on the density of its local neighborhood. The LOF is computed by comparing the density of an object's neighborhood to the densities of the neighborhoods of its nearest neighbors. If the density of an object's neighborhood is significantly lower than the densities of its neighbors' neighborhoods, then it is considered an outlier (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n1. is best to use when you have an idea of the distribution of your data, ideally if the data is normally distributed. This is especially the case for very large datasets.\n\n2. Is best when you expect outliers spread across the distribution, but you don't know the distribution.\n\n3. Is best when you want to identify outliers in clusters or in varying densities because you compare the data points to their neighbors. To decide, you can assess the distribution visually. For a better overview of the different approaches to handling outliers in general, see [[Outlier_Detection_in_Python|here]].\nIn general, many outlier detection methods are available ready-to-use in numerous python packages. This is an example of using the local outlier factor from the package scikit-learn:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports the necessary packages for visualization.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor ## imports the function for the local outlier function \n\nlof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=20, contamination=.03)## considers 20 neighboured data points and expects 3% of the data to be outliers (see contamination)\nprediction = lof.fit_predict(df['usage_kwh'].to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1))## transforms the electricity usage columns to a NumPy array (\"to_numpy()\") and reshapes it to a single column (\"reshape (-1, 1)\"), fit.predict then predicts the outliers (outlier if the prediction = -1)\ndf['outlier'] = prediction == -1 ## creates a new column in the initial dataframe called an outlier, with true or false, depending on whether it is an outlier or not\n\noutliers = df[df['outlier']] ## creates  a column where only outliers are selected","* Jolliffe, I.

It often occurs in fields like engineering, finance, or economics to analyze trends and patterns over time. Time series data is typically numeric data, for example, the stock price of a specific stock, sampled at an hourly interval, over a time frame of several months. It could also be sensory data from a fitness tracker, sampling the heart rate every 30 seconds, or a GPS track of the last run.\nIn this article, we will see examples from a household energy consumption dataset having data for longer than a year, obtained from [https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/datasets\/jaganadhg\/house-hold-energy-data Kaggle] (Download date: 20.12.2022). \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport numpy as np ## to prepare your data\nimport pandas as pd ## to prepare your data\nimport plotly.express as px ## to visualize your data\nimport os ## to set your working directory\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIt is important to check which folder Python believes to be working in. If you have saved the dataset in another folder, you can either change the working directory or move the dataset. Make sure your dataset is in a location that is easy to find and does not have a long path since this can produce errors in setting the working directory. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n##Check current working directory\ncurrent_dir = os.getcwd()\nprint(current_dir)\n## Change working directory if needed\nos.chdir('\/path\/to\/your\/directory')\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndf = pd.read_csv('D202.csv')\ndf.head()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nBy looking at the first few rows we can see that the electric usage is documented every 15 minutes.

These two columns are transformed into a date and time format. \nWe then create the dataframe \u201ccost_dollars\u201d by creating the dataframe based on the COST column and transform it to float data. \nThe USAGE column is then renamed and we drop a number of columns that are not needed.\n\nThe dataset contains about 2 years of data, we will only have a look at the first 2 weeks. For this we use iloc. iloc is an indexing method (by Pandas) with which you can choose a slice of your dataset based on its numerical position. Note that it follows the logic of exclusive indexing, meaning that the end index provided is not included.\nTo select the slice we want we first specify the rows. In our case, we chose the rows from 0 (indicated by a blank space before the colon) to the 4*14*24th row. This is because we want the first fourteen days and one day is 4*24 data points. We want all columns which is why we don't specify anything after that. If we wanted to, we would have to separate the row indexes with a comma and provide indexes for the columns.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndf = df.iloc[:24*4*14]\ndf.head()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>"],"49":["[[File:Lueneburg 2030.jpg|thumb|left|L\u00fcneburg 2030+ ist ein wunderbares Beispiel f\u00fcr eine Reihe von Realwelt-Eperimenten.

Diese Experimente k\u00f6nnen jedoch als eine Fortsetzung des Trends der nat\u00fcrlichen Experimente angesehen werden, bei denen eine l\u00f6sungsorientierte Agenda versucht, eine oder mehrere Interventionen zu generieren, deren Wirkungen oft in Einzelf\u00e4llen getestet werden, wobei die Bewertungskriterien jedoch bereits vor der Durchf\u00fchrung der Studie klar sind.

Botanische Experimente wurden schon lange vorher durchgef\u00fchrt, aber es waren die Agrarwissenschaften, die die notwendigen methodischen Entw\u00fcrfe zusammen mit den geeigneten [[Bachelor Statistics Lecture|statistischen Analysen]] entwickelten und damit eine statistische Revolution ausl\u00f6sten, die in zahlreichen Wissenschaftsbereichen Wellen schlug.

In diesem vierj\u00e4hrigen Projekt wurde versucht, '''die \u00f6kologische, soziale und wirtschaftliche Rolle und die Auswirkungen des Besatzfischs in nat\u00fcrlichen \u00d6kosystemen zu verstehen'''. Zun\u00e4chst wurden Fische in die \u00d6kosysteme eingef\u00fchrt und die nachfolgende Populationsdynamik qualitativ und quantitativ gemessen, vieles davon gemeinsam mit den kooperierenden Anglern (\"Kooperation\"). Zweitens wurden die Angler*innen \u00fcber die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Fischpopulationen und ihre wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen befragt (''Konsultation''), bevor die Daten mit Hilfe von monet\u00e4ren Modellen analysiert wurden. Drittens wurden Entscheidungsprozesse auf der Grundlage von Gespr\u00e4chen mit den Angler*innen modelliert und ihre mentalen Modelle \u00fcber das Angeln ausgewertet (''Konsultation''). Viertens wurden partizipative Workshops durchgef\u00fchrt, um die Angler bei der Optimierung ihrer Fischgr\u00fcnde zu unterst\u00fctzen (''Empowerment''). F\u00fcnftens wurden auf der Grundlage der bisherigen empirischen Ergebnisse sozial-\u00f6kologische Modelle entwickelt (''Konsultation''). Zuletzt werden die Projektergebnisse in verschiedenen Medien f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Zielgruppen ver\u00f6ffentlicht (''Information'').\n\n* Ein weiteres interessantes Beispiel ist der Artikel [https:\/\/www.ecologyandsociety.org\/vol23\/iss2\/art9\/ \"Kombination von partizipativer Szenarioplanung und Systemmodellierung zur Identifizierung von Treibern der zuk\u00fcnftigen Nachhaltigkeit auf der mongolischen Hochebene\"]. Um '''m\u00f6gliche zuk\u00fcnftige sozial-\u00f6kologische Entwicklungen in der Mongolei abzusch\u00e4tzen''', f\u00fchrten die Forscher*innen zun\u00e4chst einen Workshop mit Interessenvertreter*innen durch, haupts\u00e4chlich aus dem akademischen Bereich, aber mit unterschiedlichen disziplin\u00e4ren Hintergr\u00fcnden, und einigen wenigen nicht-wissenschaftlichen Akteur*innen. In diesem Workshop wurden zun\u00e4chst die Schl\u00fcsselelemente identifiziert, die die nachhaltige Entwicklung in der Region beeinflussen. Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt wurden diese dann in eine Rangfolge gebracht, um kritische Unsicherheiten zu identifizieren, die zur Entwicklung potenzieller Zukunftsszenarien f\u00fchrten (\"Konsultation\"). Auch die Meinungen der Interessenvertreter*innen zum Workshop wurden sp\u00e4ter durch Interviews bewertet, was auf positive Auswirkungen auf ihre Arbeit und Perspektiven hinwies (\"Empowerment\"). Die Erkenntnisse aus den Workshops wurden von den Forscher*innen in systemdynamische Modelle \u00fcbersetzt, die von den Interessenvertreter*innen iterativ r\u00fcckgekoppelt wurden (''Konsultation''), was zu einem endg\u00fcltigen Modell f\u00fchrte (''Information''). Dieser Ansatz war nicht rein transdisziplin\u00e4r, sondern illustriert vor allem einen beispielhaften transdisziplin\u00e4ren Arbeitsablauf.","Aus einer bestimmten Perspektive ist unser ganzer Planet ein nat\u00fcrliches Experiment, und es ist auch aus statistischer Sicht ein Problem, f\u00fcr das wir keine Wiederholungen haben, abgesehen von anderen Verzweigungen und Unklarheiten, die sich aus solchen Einzelfallstudien ergeben, die jedoch oft auch in kleinerem Ma\u00dfstab zunehmend relevant sind. Mit der Zunahme qualitativer Methoden in Vielfalt und F\u00fclle und dem Drang, auch komplexe Systeme und F\u00e4lle zu verstehen, besteht eindeutig ein Bedarf an der Integration von Wissen aus nat\u00fcrlichen Experimenten. '''Aus statistischer Sicht sind solche F\u00e4lle schwierig und herausfordernd, da sie nicht reproduzierbar sind, aber das Wissen kann dennoch relevant, plausibel und g\u00fcltig sein.''' Zu diesem Zweck proklamiere ich das Konzept der Nische, um zu veranschaulichen und zu konzeptualisieren, wie einzelne F\u00e4lle immer noch zur Produktion und zum Kanon des Wissens beitragen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nZum Beispiel die [https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/rcfs\/article\/4\/2\/155\/1555737#113865691 Finanzkrise von 2007], bei der viele Muster mit fr\u00fcheren Krisen vergleichbar waren, aber andere Faktoren anders waren. Daher ist diese Krise in Bezug auf einige Informationsebenen mit vielen fr\u00fcheren Faktoren und Mustern vergleichbar, aber auch in Bezug auf andere Dynamiken neu und nicht \u00fcbertragbar. Wir haben jedoch aufgrund des Einzelfalls dieser Finanzkrise verstanden, dass bestimmte Konstrukte in unseren Finanzsystemen korrupt sind, wenn nicht gar inh\u00e4rent fehlerhaft. Der Beitrag zur Weiterentwicklung der Finanzwelt ist daher unbestreitbar, auch soweit, dass viele Menschen darin \u00fcbereinstimmen, dass die vorgenommenen Ver\u00e4nderungen sicherlich nicht ausreichen. \n\nEin weiteres prominentes Beispiel f\u00fcr einen oder mehrere Einzelf\u00e4lle oder Ph\u00e4nomene ist die Covid-19-Pandemie, die sich weiter ausbreitet, w\u00e4hrend ich diese Zeilen schreibe. W\u00e4hrend aus fr\u00fcheren Pandemien viel gelernt wurde, ist diese Pandemie anders, entwickelt sich anders und hat andere Auswirkungen. Die Auswirkungen unserer Gesellschaften und die M\u00f6glichkeit, aus dieser Pandemie zu lernen, sind jedoch unbestreitbar. W\u00e4hrend klassische Experimente Wissen wie Bauern in einem Schachspiel entwickeln und Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt voranschreiten, gleicht eine Krise wie die Covid-Pandemie eher dem Pferd in einem Schachspiel, springt \u00fcber gr\u00f6\u00dfere L\u00fccken, ist weniger vorhersehbar und sicherlich schwieriger zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Die Evolution des Wissens in einer vernetzten Welt erfordert oft einen eher singul\u00e4ren Ansatz als Ausgangspunkt. Dies ist besonders wichtig in den normativen Wissenschaften, wo zum Beispiel in der Naturschutzbiologie viele Forscher L\u00f6sungen durch singul\u00e4re Fallstudien angehen. Aus diesem Grund entstand die l\u00f6sungsorientierte Agenda der Nachhaltigkeitswissenschaften, die diesem Umstand und dar\u00fcber hinaus Rechnung tr\u00e4gt.\n\n[[File:Lueneburg 2030.jpg|thumb|left|L\u00fcneburg 2030+ ist ein wunderbares Beispiel f\u00fcr eine Reihe von Realwelt-Eperimenten.
