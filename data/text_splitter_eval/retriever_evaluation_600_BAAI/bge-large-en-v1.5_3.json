This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A\/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process. To ensure the trustworthiness of the results of A\/B tests, the scheme of [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|scientific experiments]] is followed, consisting of a planning phase, an execution phase, and an evaluation phase.\n\n==Planning Phase==\nDuring the planning phase, a goal and hypothesis are formulated, and a study design is developed that specifies the sample size, the duration of the study, and the metrics to be measured. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of the test.\n\n===Goal Definition===\nThe goal identifies problems or optimization potential to improve the software product. For example, in the case of a website, the goal could be to increase newsletter subscriptions or improve the conversion rate through changing parts of the website.\n\n===Hypotheses Formulation===\nTo determine if a particular change is better than the default version, a two-sample hypothesis test is conducted to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the two samples (version A and B). This involves stating the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n\nFrom the perspective of an A\/B test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the control and treatment group, while the alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the two groups which is influenced by a non-random cause.\n\nIn most cases, it is not known a priori whether the discrepancy in the results between A and B is in favor of A or B. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis should consider the possibility that both versions A and B have different levels of efficiency. In order to account for this, a two-sided test is typically preferred for the subsequent evaluation.\n\n'''For example:'''\n\n\"To fix the problem that there are hardly any subscriptions for my newsletter, I will put the sign-up box higher up on the website.\"\n\nGoal: Increase the newsletter subscriptions on the website.\n\nH0: There are no significant changes in the number of new newsletter subscribers between the control and treatment versions.","Depending on the type of data being collected different [[Simple Statistical Tests|statistical tests]] should be considered. For example, when dealing with discrete metrics such as click-through rate, the [https:\/\/mathworld.wolfram.com\/FishersExactTest.html Fisher exact test] can be used to calculate the exact p-value, while the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug chi-squared test] may be more appropriate for larger sample sizes.\n\nIn the case of continuous metrics, such as average revenue per user, the [[T-Test|t-test or Welch's t-test]] may be used to determine the significance of the treatment effect. However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https:\/\/data.library.virginia.edu\/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test\/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate.\n\n==Advantages and Limitations of A\/B Testing==\n'''Advantages'''\nA\/B testing has several advantages over traditional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a product or design. First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.","Koning, Rembrand, Sharique Hasan, and Aaron Chatterji. \u201cExperimentation and Start-up Performance: Evidence from A\/B Testing.\u201d Management Science 68, no. 9 (September 2022): 6434\u201353. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1287\/mnsc.2021.4209Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nSiroker, Dan, and Pete Koomen.

The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.\n\nIn addition, the ANOVA is equally limited as the regression, as both build on the [[Data_distribution#The_normal_distribution|normal distribution]]. Extensions of the ANOVA translated its analytical approach into the logic of [[Generalized Linear Models|generalised linear models]], enabling the implementation of other distributions as well. What unites all different approaches is the demand that the ANOVA has in terms of data, and with increasing complexity, the demands increase when it comes to the sample sizes. Within experimental settings, this can be quite demanding, which is why the ANOVA only allows to test very constructed settings of the world. All categories that are implemented as predictors in an ANOVA design represent a constructed worldview, which can be very robust, but is always a compromise. The ANOVA thus tries to approximate causality by creating more rigid designs. However, we have to acknowledge that experimental designs are always compromises, and more knowledge may become available later. Within clinical trials - most of which have an ANOVA design at their heart - great care is taken into account in terms of robustness and documentation, and clinical trial stages are built on increasing sample sizes to minimise the harm on humans in these experiments.\n\n'''Taken together, the ANOVA is one of the most relevant calculation tools to fuel the exponential growth that characterised the 20th century.''' Agricultural experiments and medical trials are widely built on the ANOVA, yet we also increasingly recognise the limitations of this statistical model. Around the millennium, new models emerged, such as [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. But at its core, the ANOVA is the basis of modern deductive statistical analysis.","====Analysis of Variance====\n'''The [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/a\/anova.asp ANOVA] is one key analysis tool of [[Experiments|laboratory experiments]]''' - but also other experiments as we shall see later. This statistical test is - mechanically speaking - comparing the means of more than two groups by extending the restriction of the [[Simple_Statistical_Tests#Two_sample_t-test|t-test]]. Comparing different groups became thus a highly important procedure in the design of experiments, which is, apart from laboratories, also highly relevant in greenhouse experiments in ecology, where conditions are kept stable through a controlled environment. \n\nThe general principle of the ANOVA is rooted in [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]]. An idealized null hypothesis is formulated against which the data is being tested. If the ANOVA gives a significant result, then the null hypothesis is rejected, hence it is statistically unlikely that the data confirms the null hypothesis. As one gets an overall p-value, it can be thus confirmed whether the different groups differ overall. Furthermore, the ANOVA allows for a measure beyond the p-value through the '''sum of squares calculations''' which derive how much is explained by the data, and how large in relation the residual or unexplained information is.\n\n====Preconditions====\nRegarding the preconditions of the [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oOuu8IBd-yo ANOVA], it is important to realize that the data should ideally be '''normally distributed''' on all levels, which however is often violated due to small sample sizes. Since a non-normal distribution may influence the outcome of the test, boxplots are a helpful visual aid, as these allow for a simple detection tool of non-normal distribution levels. \n\nEqually should ideally the variance be comparable across all levels, which is called '''[https:\/\/blog.minitab.com\/blog\/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis\/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia homoscedastic]'''. What is also important is the criteria of '''independence''', meaning that samples of factor levels should not influence each other. For this reason are for instance in ecological experiments plants typically planted in individual pots. In addition does the classical ANOVA assume a '''balanced design''', which means that all factor levels have an equal sample size. If some factor levels have less samples than others, this might pose interactions in terms of normals distribution and variance, but there is another effect at play. Larger sample sizes on one factor level may create a disbalance, where factor levels with larger samples pose a larger influence on the overall model result.","====Challenges of ANOVA experiments====\nThe ANOVA builds on a constructed world, where factor levels are like all variables constructs, which might be prone to errors or misconceptions. We should therefore realize that a non-significant result might also be related to the factor level construction. Yet a potential flaw can also range beyond implausible results, since ANOVAs do not necessarily create valid knowledge. If the underlying theory is imperfect, then we might confirm a hypothesis that is overall wrong. Hence the strong benefit of the ANOVA - the systematic testing of hypothesis - may equally be also its weakest point, as science develops, and previous hypothesis might have been imperfect if not wrong. \n\nFurthermore, many researchers use the ANOVA today in an inductive sense. With more and more data becoming available, even from completely undersigned sampling sources, the ANOVA becomes the analysis of choice if the difference between different factor levels is investigated for a continuous variable. Due to the [[Glossary|emergence]] of big data, these applications could be seen critical, since no real hypothesis are being tested. Instead, the statistician becomes a gold digger, searching the vastness of the available data for patterns, [[Causality#Correlation_is_not_Causality|may these be causal or not]]. While there are numerous benefits, this is also a source of problems. Non-designed datasets will for instance not be able to test for the impact a drug might have on a certain diseases. This is a problem, as systematic knowledge production is almost assumed within the ANOVA, but its application these days is far away from it. The inductive and the deductive world become intertwined, and this poses a risk for the validity of scientific results.\n\nFor more on the Analysis of Variance, please refer to the [[ANOVA]] entry.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Guinea pig computer.jpg|thumb|right|The tooth growth of guinea pigs is a good R data set to illustrate how the ANOVA works]]\n===Toothgrowth of guinea pigs===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#To find out, what the ToothGrowth data set is about: ?ToothGrowth\n\n#The code is partly from boxplot help (?boxplot).

Here, an imperfect or a small sample would serve as basis for statistical interference. Very crudely defined, the two approaches start at exact opposite ends. While frequency statistics demand preconditions such as sample size and a normal distribution for specific statistical tests, Bayesian statistics build on the existing sample size; all calculations base on what is already there. Experts may excuse my dramatic simplification, but one could say that frequentist statistics are top-down thinking, while [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach\/ Bayesian statistics] work bottom-up. The history of modern science is widely built on frequentist statistics, which includes such approaches as methodological design, sampling density and replicates, and diverse statistical tests. It is nothing short of a miracle that Bayes proposed the theoretical foundation for the theory named after him more than 250 years ago. Only with the rise of modern computers was this theory explored deeply, and builds the foundation of branches in data science and machine learning. The two approaches are also often coined as objectivists for frequentist probability fellows, and subjectivists for folllowers of [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9TDjifpGj-k Bayes theorem]. \n\nAnother perspective on the two approaches can be built around the question whether we design studies - or whether we base our analysis on the data we just have. This debate is the basis for the deeply entrenched conflicts you have in statistics up until today, and was already the basis for the conflicts between Pearson and Fisher. From an epistemological perspective, this can be associated with the question of inductive or [[Glossary|deductive reasoning]], although not many statisticians might not be too keen to explore this relation deeply, since they are often stuck in either deductive or inductive thinking, but not both.","== Bayes Theorem ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously.

In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach.

Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances.

Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional acts per se. Still, consequentialism and a focus on mere actions is also relevant because it allows to step away from a single agent and focus instead on the interactions within the agency of several actors, which is a good start for the next concept.\n\n\n== Complexity ==\nMany phenomena in nature are simple, and follow simple rules. Many other phenomena are not simple, but instead can be defined as \"complex\". In order to negotiate between the two there is the fundamental law of Occam's razor, which defines that all things are as simple as possible, and as complex as necessary. Complex system theory strongly developed over the last decades, and created ripples into all empirical science and beyond. '''What is however problematic is that no unified and universally accepted definition of complexity exists, which is quite ironic.''' It seems that complexity in itself is complex. Here, I will therefore focus on some of the main arguments and characteristics that are relevant from a methodological standpoint. First of all, I will restrict all considerations to 'complex systems'. To this end, I simply define [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|\u201esystems\u201c]] as any number of individuals or elements that interact. Complex Systems, then, are systems that are composed of many components which may interact with each other in various ways and which are therefore difficult to model. Specific properties include [[Glossary|non-linearity]], emergence, adaptation and [[Glossary|feedback loops]]. From a methodological standpoint we should be able to observe these interactions, while from a philosophical standpoint we should be able to reflect upon them. For more background on the definition of System Boundaries, please refer to [[System Boundaries|this entry.]]","What is however clear is that the three concepts - agency, complexity and emergence - have consequences about our premises of empirical knowledge. What if ultimately nothing is generalisable? What if all valid arguments are only valid for a certain time? And what if some strata will forever escape a truly reliable measurement? We [[Big problems for later|cannot answer]] these problems here, yet it is important to differentiate what we know, what we may be able to know, and what we will probably never know. The [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/uncertainty-principle uncertainty principle of Heisenberg] in Quantum mechanics which refers to the the position and momentum of particles illustrates that some things cannot be approximated, observed or known. Equal claims can be made about larger phenomena, such as personal identity. Hence, as much as agency, complex systems and emergence can be boundary objects for methods, they equally highlight our (current) limitations.\n\n\n== The way forward ==\nIf we want to empirically investigate agency, we first and foremost investigate individuals, or actions of entities we consider as non-variable, or consequences of actions of individuals. All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.''' Because of this, much of our current knowledge of agency is either rooted in widely deductive experimental settings or the testing of very clear hypotheses, or questions of either logic or metaphysics, which are widely associated with philosophy.","== Methodological implications ==\nConsidering these three concept, from a methodological standpoint we should consequently ask which entities lack agency, which systems are simple, and which interconnected phenomena defy any emergence. Falsification is one of the most important principles of science, and applying this approach to these three concepts can help us approximate the current methodological frontier in science. The word \"current\" is of central importance here, because we have to understand that all three concepts are at least partly normative, because they revolve around our current state of knowledge. Individuals that we deny agency now may be attributed agency by our grid of theory and methods at some point. Systems that seem complex today may be simple in the future. Emergent phenomena today may enable predictability of future interconnections. '''To this end, these three concepts are merely snapshots of our own ignorance'''. Right now we cannot know whether in the very long run all agency will be tracked, all systems will be simple, and all interconnections predictable, which right now only philosophy can examine. I think empirical research right now is incapable to answer how much people in the future may be able to understand, but it is not for us to decide how much will be explained in the future. \n\nWhat is clearer is that ''agency'' widely revolves around complex experimental designs that bridge different realms of science, such as neuroscience and psychology, psychology and microeconomics or behavioural science and zoology. The concept of agency links different fields of inquiry. Besides our diverse theories when it comes to agency, we only start to fully acknowledge the challenges related to its measurement as well as the opportunities to bridge different domains of sciences. From an empirical standpoint, agency has not been systematically accessed, which is why much emphasis is given to some few studies, and existing schools of thought often build on diverse premises. A good example to access agency is for instance in the combination of psychological or behaviour focused experiments with neurological examinations, although even such complicated experimental settings are not free of ambiguous results. Another methodological approach to agency could be in gamification, since such approaches would be able to test behavior of players within a complex environment, including reactions and motivations. The concept of altruism does however illustrate that, for the time being, the explanation of such behaviors may be unattainable. Just like agency, altruism can be divided into evolutionary or metaphysical explanations, roughly speaking. Time will tell if these schools of thought can be bridged."],"4":["Ordination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework. More on this point later. Let us now begin with a presentation of the diverse ordination types and their respective origins. \n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===","<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.shape# you can see here the number of rows (72) and columns (7)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nResult: (72,7)\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nduplicates= data.duplicated()## checks for duplicates which would distort the results\nprint(duplicates)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThere is  no duplicated data so we can move on analyising the dataset.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.info()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nHere, you can get an overview over the different datatypes, if there are missing values (\"non-null\") and how many entries each column has. Our columns where we wish to make a quantitative analysis should be int64 (without decimal components) or float64 (with decimal components), but id can be ignored since it is only an individual signifier. The variables with the \"object\" data format can contain several data formats. However, looking at the three variables, we can see that they are in a categorical data format, having the categories for gender, whether one passed an exam or not, and the category of the different study groups. These categorical variables cannot be used for a regression analysis as the other variables since we cannot analyze an increase in one unit of this variables and its effect on the dependent variable. Instead, we can see how belonging to one of the categories affects the independent variable. For \"sex\" and \"passed\", these are dummy variables. Columns we will treat as dummy variables can take categories in binary format. We can then for example see if and how being female impacts the dependent variable.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.describe()## here you can an overview over the standard descriptive data.\n<\/syntaxhighlight> \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.columns #This command shows you the variables you will be able to use.

In this case, the term \u2018residual\u2019 refers to the difference between observed and predicted data (Dheeraja V.2022).\n\nIf the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.","'''How do I know?'''\n* Check the entry on [[Data formats]] to understand the difference between categorical and numeric variables.\n* Investigate your data using <code>str<\/code> or <code>summary<\/code>.

Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution.","Depending on the existence of random variables, there is a distinction between Mixed Effect Models, and Generalised Linear Models based on regressions.\n\n<imagemap>Image:Statistics Flowchart - GLM random variables.png|650px|center|\npoly 289 4 153 141 289 270 422 137 [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis#Generalised_Linear_Models]]\npoly 139 151 3 288 139 417 272 284 [[Mixed Effect Models]]\npoly 439 149 303 286 439 415 572 282 [[Generalized Linear Models]]\n<\/imagemap>\n\n'''How do I know?'''\n* Random variables introduce extra variability to the model.

Search terms: 'Clustering', 'Cluster Analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nCluster analysis shares history in various fields such as anthropology, psychology, biology, medicine, business, computer science, and social science. \n\nIt originated in anthropology when Driver and Kroeber published Quantitative Expression of Cultural Relationships in 1932 where they sought to clusters of [[Glossary|culture]] based on different culture elements. Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as ''similarity measure'' or ''distance measure'', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named \"unsupervised learning\", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term \"clustering\" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.","We can see that k-Means performs quite good at separating the data into three clusters. However, if we increase the variance in the dataset, k-Means does not perform as well. (See image below)\n\n[[File:Result of K-Means Clustering (High Variance).png| |Result of K-Means Clustering (High Variance)]]\n\n==== Strengths and Weaknesses of k-Means Clustering ====\n\n'''Strengths'''\n* It is intuitive to understand.\n* It is relatively easy to implement.\n* It adapts to new data points and guarantees convergence.\n\n'''Weaknesses'''\n* The number of clusters ''k'' has to be chosen manually.\n* The vanilla k-Means algorithm cannot accommodate cases with a high number of clusters (high ''k'').\n* The k-Means clustering algorithm clusters ''all'' the data points. As a result, the centroids are affected by outliers.\n* As the dimension of the dataset increases, the performance of the algorithm starts to deteriorate.\n\n=== Hierarchical Clustering ===\nAs the name suggests, hierarchical clustering is a clustering method that builds a ''hierarchy'' of clusters. \n\nUnlike k-means clustering algorithms - as discussed above -, this clustering method does not require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand. As a result, this method is sometimes used to identify the number of clusters that a dataset has before applying other clustering algorithms that require us to specify the number of clusters at the beginning.\n\nThere are two strategies when performing hierarchical clustering:\n\n==== Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering ====\n\nThis is a \"bottom-up\" approach of building hierarchy which starts by treating each data point as a single cluster, and successively merging pairs of clusters, or agglomerating, until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data points. Each observation belongs to its own cluster, then pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.\n\n==== Implementation of Agglomerative Clustering ====\nThe first example of agglomerative clustering is performed using the hclust function built in to R.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nlibrary(dendextend)\n\n# generate data\ndf <- create_cluster_data(50, 1, 3, random_state=7)\n# create the distance matrix\ndist_df = dist(df[, 2], method=\"euclidean\") \n# perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering\nhc_df = hclust(dist_df, method=\"complete\")\n# create a simple plot of the dendrogram\nplot(hc_df)","'''Other Clustering Methods'''\n* A.

Statistics are quite established in science, and much information is available in a form that allows you to conduct statistics. However, will statistics be able to generate a piece of the puzzle you are looking at? Do you have an underlying theory that can be put into constructs that enable a statistical design? Or do you assume that a rather open research question can be approached through a broad inductive sampling? The publication landscape, experienced researchers as well as pre-test may shed light on the question whether statistics can contribute solving your problem. \n\n2) '''What are the efforts you need to put into the initial data gathering?''' If you decided that statistics would be valuable to be applied, the question then would be, how? To rephrase this statement: How exactly? Your sampling with all its constructs, sample sizes and replicates decides about the fate of everything you going to do later. A flawed dataset or a small or biased sample will lead to failure, or even worse, wrong results. Play it safe in the beginning, do not try to overplay your hand. Slowly edge your way into the application of statistics, and always reflect with others about your sampling strategy.","* '''Data Collection''': When the research focus is chosen, the data necessary for Social Network Analysis can be gathered in [[Survey Research|Surveys]] or [[Interviews]], through [[Ethnography|Observation]], [[Content Analysis]] (typically literature-based) or similar forms of data gathering. Surveys and Interviews are most common, with the researchers asking individuals about the existence and strength of connections between themselves and others actors, or within other actors excluding themselves (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14). There are two common approaches when surveying individuals about their own connections to others: In a ''prompted recall'' approach, they are asked which people they would think of with regards to a specific topic (e.g. \"To whom would you go for advice at work?\") while they are shown a pre-determined list of potentially relevant individuals. In the ''free list'' approach, they are asked to recall individuals without seeing a list (Butts 2008, p.20f).\n* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape.\nImportantly, the actual distance between nodes is thus not equatable with the physical distance in a [[Glossary|visualisation]]. Sometimes, nodes that are visually very close to each other are actually very far away. The actual distance between elements of the network should be measured based on the \"number of lines which it is necessary to traverse in order to get from one point to another.\" (Scott 1988, p.114)\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Network Types.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Different network structures.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.893]]","==== Step by Step ====\n* '''Type of Network:''' First, Social Network Analysts decide whether they intend to focus on a holistic view on the network (''whole networks''), or focus on the network surrounding a specific node of interest (''ego networks''). They also decide for either ''one-mode networks'', focusing on one type of node that could be connected with any other; or ''two-mode networks'' where there are two types of nodes, with each node unable to be connected with another node of the same type (Marin & Wellman 2010, 13). For a two-mode network, you could imagine an analysis of social events and the individuals that visit these, where each event is not connected to another event, but only to other individuals; and vice-versa.\n* '''Network boundaries:''' In a next step, the approach to defining nodes needs to be chosen. Three ways of defining networks can be named according to Marin & Wellman (2010, p.2, referring to Laumann et al. (1983)). These three are approaches not mutually exclusive and may be combined:\n** ''position-based approach'': considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally-defined positions to be network members, and all others would be excluded\n** ''event-based'' approach: those who had participated in key events are believed to define the population\n** ''relation-based approach'': begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.\n** Butts (2008) adds the ''exogenously defined boundaries'', which are pre-determined based on the research intent or theory which provide clearly specified entities of interest.\n* '''Type of ties:''' Then, the researcher needs to decide on which kinds of ties to focus. There can be two forms of ties between network nodes: ''directed'' ties, which go from one node to another, and ''undirected ties'', that connect two nodes without any distinct direction. Both types can either be [[Data formats|binary]] (they exist, or do not exist), or valued (they can be stronger or weaker than other ties): As an example, \"(..) a friendship network can be represented using binary ties that indicate if two people are friends, or using valued ties that assign higher or lower scores based on how close people feel to one another, or how often they interact.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14; Borgatti et al. 2009)"],"8":["'''In short:'''\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the \"noise\" caused by covariate variable that is not of experimental interest.

In this case, 'objective' refers to 'intersubjective'. Yet, biases cannot be entirely prevented, e.g. in the sampling process, the development of the coding scheme, or the interpretation and evaluation of the coded data.\n* Content Analysis allows for researchers to apply their own social-scientific constructs \"by which texts may become meaningful in ways that a culture may not be aware of.\" (Krippendorff 1989, p.404)\n* However, especially in case of qualitative analysis of smaller data sample sizes, the theory and hypotheses derived from data cannot be generalized beyond this data (1). Triangulation, i.e. the comparison of the findings to other knowledge on the same topic, may provide more validity to the conclusions (see Normativity).\n\n\n== Normativity ==\n==== Quality Criteria ====\n* Reliability is difficult to maintain in the Content Analysis. A clear and unambiguous definition of codes as well as testings for inter-coder reliability represent attempts to ensure inter-subjectivity and thus stability and reproducibility (3, 4). However, the ambiguous nature of the data demands an interpretative analysis process - especially in the qualitative approach. This interpretation process of the texts or contents may interfere with the intended inter-coder reliability.\n* Validity of the inferred results - i.e. the fitting of the results to the intended kind of knowledge - may be reached a) through the researchers' knowledge of contextual factors of the data and b) through validation with other sources, e.g. by the means of triangulation. However, the latter can be difficult to do due to the uniqueness of the data (1-3). Any content analysis is a reduction of the data, which should be acknowledged critically, and which is why the coding scheme should be precise and include the aforementioned explanation, examples and exclusion criteria.\n\n==== Connectedness ====\n* Since verbal discourse is an important data source for Content Analysis, the latter is often used as an analysis method of transcripts of standardized, [[Open Interview|open]], or [[Semi-structured Interview|semi-structured interviews]].\n* Content Analysis is one form of textual analysis. The latter also includes other approaches such as discourse analysis, rhetorical analysis, or [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis (2). However, Content Analysis differs from these methods in terms of methodological elements and the kinds of questions it addresses (2).","* Last, the coded data are ''analyzed and interpreted'' whilst taking into account the theoretical constructs that underlie the research. Inferences are drawn, which - according to Mayring (2000) - may focus on the communicator, the message itself, the socio-cultural context of the message, or on the message's effect. The learnings may be validated in the face of other information sources, which is often difficult when Content Analysis is used in cases where there is no other possibility to access this knowledge. Finally, new hypotheses may also be formulated (all from 1, 2).","== What the method does ==\nContent Analysis is a \"(...) systematic, replicable technique for compressing many words of text into fewer content categories based on explicit rules of coding\" (Stemler 2000, p.1). However, the method entails more than mere word-counting. Instead, Content Analysis relies on the interpretation of the [[Glossary|data]] on behalf of the researcher. The mostly qualitative data material is assessed by creating a category system relevant to the material, and attributing parts of the content to individual categories (Schreier 2014). Not only the content of a source is evaluated, but also formal aspects as well as contextual psychological, institutional, and cultural elements of the communication process (1, 4). \"[Content Analysis] seeks to analyze data within a specific context in view of the meanings someone - a group or a culture - attributes to them.\" (Krippendorff 1989, p.403). Because of this, Content Analysis is a potent method to identify trends and patterns in (text) sources, to determine authorship, or to monitor (public) opinions on a specific topic (3). \n\nApart from text, a diverse set of data can be analyzed using Content Analysis. \"Anything that occurs in sufficient numbers and has reasonably stable meanings for a specific group of people may be subjected to content analysis.\" (Krippendorff 1989, p.404). The data must convey a message to the receiver and be durable (2, 3). Often, Content Analysis focuses on data that are difficult or impossible to interpret with other methods (3). The data may exist 'naturally' and be publicly available, for example verbal discourse, written documents, or visual representations from mass media (newspapers, books, films, comics etc.); or be rather unavailable to the public, such as personal letters or witness accounts. The data may also be generated for the research purpose (e.g. interview transcripts) (1, 2, 4).  \n\nWhile there is a wide range of qualitative Content Analysis approaches, this entry will focus on joint characteristics of these.

The Pearson correlation is usually applied to normally distributed data, or more precisely, data that shows a [https:\/\/365datascience.com\/students-t-distribution\/ Student's t-distribution]. Alternative correlation measures like [https:\/\/www.statisticssolutions.com\/kendalls-tau-and-spearmans-rank-correlation-coefficient\/ Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho] are usually applied to variables that are not normally distributed. I recommend you just look them up, and keep as a rule of thumb that Spearman's rho is the most robust correlation measure when it comes to non-normally distributed data.\n\n==== Calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient r ====\nThe formula to calculate [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2B_UW-RweSE a Pearson correlation coefficient] is fairly simple. You just need to keep in mind that you have two variables or samples, called x and y, and their respective means (m). \n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-02 um 09.46.54.png|400px|center|thumb|This is the formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient r.]]\n<br\/>\n\n=== Conducting and reading correlations ===\nThere are some core questions related to the application and reading of correlations. These can be of interest whenever you have the correlation coefficient at hand - for example, in a statistical software - or when you see a correlation plot.<br\/>\n\n'''1) Is the relationship between two variables positive or negative?''' If one variable increases, and the other one increases, too, we have  a positive (\"+\") correlation. This is also true if both variables decrease. For instance, being taller leads to a significant increase in\u00a0[https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3534609\/ body weight]. On the other hand, if one variable increases, and the other decreases, the correlation is negative (\"-\"): for example, the relationship between 'pizza eaten' and 'pizza left' is negative. The more pizza slices are eaten, the fewer slices are still there. This direction of the relationship tells you a lot about how two variables might be logically connected. The normative value of a positive or negative relation typically has strong implications, especially if both directions are theoretically possible. Therefore it is vital to be able to interpret the direction of a correlative relationship.","== Partial Correlation vs. Multiple Linear Regression ==\nWhen thinking about partial correlation, one might notice that the basic idea is similar to a multiple linear regression. Even though a correlation is bidirectional while a regression aims at explaining one variable by another, in both approaches we try to identify the true and unbiased relationship of two variables. So when should we use which method? In general, partial correlation is a building step for multiple linear regression. Accordingly, linear regression has a broader range of applications and is therefore in most cases the method to choose. Using a linear regression, one can model interaction terms and it is also possible to loosen some\nassumptions by using a [[Generalized_Linear_Models|generalized linear model]]. Nevertheless, one advantage, partial correlation has over linear regression, is that it delivers an estimate for the relationship which is easy to interpret. The linear regression outputs weights that depend on the unit of measurement, making it hard to compare them to other models. As a work-around, one could use standardized beta coefficients. Yet those coefficients are harder to interpret since they do not necessarily have an upper bound. Partial correlation coefficients, on the other hand, are defined to range from -1 to 1.\n\n== Example for Partial Correlation using R ==\nPartial Correlation can be performed using R.

The capital of the following sample of workers is correlated to the number of annual doctor visits (r \u2248 .895).\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Fig.3\ndf <- data.frame(doctor_visits, capital, age)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:prtcrl4.png|450px|thumb|right|Fig.3: \"doctor_visits\" data frame.]]\nOne way to perform a partial correlation on this data is to manually calculate it.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# First, we calculate the 2 simple linear regressions\nmodel1 <- lm(doctor_visits~age)\nmodel2 <- lm(capital~age)\n# Next, we save the residuals of both linear models\nres1 <- model1$residuals\nres2 <- model2$residuals\n# Finally, we can calculate the partial correlation by correlating the residuals\ncor(res1, res2)\n\n## Output:\n## [1] 0.08214041\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nHowever, there are also a lot of pre-build packages for calculating a partial correlation.

This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative.

To create such a correlogram, you need to install the R package <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>corrplot<\/syntaxhighlight> and import the library. Before we start to create and customize the correlogram, we can calculate the correlation coefficients of the variables and store it in a variable.

However, comparisons to data from Bird Life International have shown that the bird abundances for rare species in the tropics are strongly over-estimated. A likely reason is that bird observers are very determined to find these rare species and thereby overlook or under-record more common species and focus on rare ones (10). \nNevertheless, as technology progresses, identification apps are becoming better and easier to use. Moreover, scientists are working on new approaches to include such data into their research in meaningful ways. This trend of increasing citizen participation is thus likely to continue.\n\nTelemetry is another method that was further developed in recent years, although it has been used already for decades in wildlife ecology. Telemetry is \u201cthe system of determining information about an animal through the use of radio signals from or to a device carried by the animal\u201d (11). For birds, this method can be applied in areas ranging in size from restricted breeding territories of resident bird species to movement patterns of international migratory species. Also, the distribution patterns of infectious diseases of migratory species can be tracked (11). However, for some birds, negative effects on nesting behavior were observed (12). \n\n== Key publications ==\n=== Theoretical ===\n\nFuller, R. J., & Langslow, D. R. (1984).

To this day, such a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem remains a reason to choose Delphi. Delphi may also be an appropriate choice if the collective subjective judgment by the experts is beneficial to the problem-solving process (2, 4, 5, 6).\n* Delphi can be used as a form of group counseling when other forms, such as face-to-face interactions between multiple stakeholders, are not feasible or even detrimental to the process due to counterproductive group dynamics (4, 5).\n* The value of the Delphi method is that it reveals clearly those ideas that are the reason for disagreements between stakeholders, and those that are consensual (5).\n* Delphi can be \"(...) a highly motivating experience for participants\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309) due to the feedback on the group's opinions that is provided in subsequent questioning stages.\n* The Delphi method with its feedback characteristic has advantages over direct confrontation of the experts, which \"(...) all too often induces the hasty formulation of preconceived notions, an inclination to close one's mind to novel ideas, a tendency to defend a stand once taken, or, alternatively and sometimes alternately, a predisposition to be swayed by persuasively stated opinions of others.\" (Okoli & Pawlowski 2004, p.2, after Dalkey & Helmer)\n* Additionally, Delphi provides several advantages over traditional surveys:\n** Studies have shown that averages of group responses are superior to averages of individual responses. (3)\n** Non-response and drop-out of participants is low in Delphi processes. (3)\n** The availability of the experts involved allows for the researchers to (a) get their precognitions on the issue verified by the participating experts and to (b) gain further qualitative data after the Delphi process. (3)","After the third round, the participants were additionally asked to fill out survey questions on a 1-5 [[Likert Scale]] about how reliable their considered their own forecasts, and how much attention they had paid to the others' forecasts and comments when these were re-distributed, both regarding each variable individually. This was done to better understand each individual's thought process.\n<br>\n[[File:Delphi - Exemplary study Kauko & Palmroos 2014 results.png|800px|thumb|center|'''The results for the Delphi process.'''

'''They found that the individual responses did indeed converge over the Delphi process, and that the \"Delphi group improved between rounds 1 and 3 in 13 of the questions.\"''' (p.320). They also found that \"[d]isagreeing with the rest of the group increased the probability of adopting a new opinion, which was usually an improvement\" (p.322) and that the Delphi process \"clearly outperformed simple trend extrapolations based on the assumption that the growth rates observed in the past will continue in the future\", which they had calculated prior to the Delphi (p.324). Based on the post-Delphi survey answers, and the results for the 15 variables, the researchers further inferred that \"paying attention to each others' answers made the forecasts more accurate\" (p.320), and that the participants were well able to assess the accuracy of their own estimates. The researchers calculated many more measures and a comparison to a non-Delphi forecasting round, which you can read more about in the publication. Overall, this example shows that the Delphi method works in that it leads to more accurate results over time, and that the process itself helps individuals better forecast than traditional forecasts would.","In 1964, a RAND report from Gordon & Helmer brought the method to attention for a wider audience outside the military defense field (4, 5). Subsequently, Delphi became a prominent method in technological forecasting; it was also adapted in management; in fields such as drug policy, education, urban planning; and applied in order to understand economic and social phenomena (2, 4, 5). An important field today is the healthcare sector (7). While during the first decade of its use the Delphi method was mostly about forecasting future scenarios, a second form was developed later that focused on concept & [[Glossary|framework]] development (3).\n\nDelphi was first applied in these non-scientific fields before it reached academia (4). Here, it can be a beneficial method to identify topics, questions, terminologies, constructs or theoretical perspectives for research endeavours (3).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nThe Delphi method is \"(...) a systematic and interactive research technique for obtaining the judgment of a panel of independent experts on a specific topics\" (Hallowell & Gambatese 2010, p.99). It is used \"(...) to obtain, exchange, and develop informed opinion on a particular topic\" and shall provide \"(...) a constructive forum in which consensus may occur\" (Rayens & Hahn 2000, p.309). Put simply, experts on a topic are gathered and asked in a systematic process what they think about the future, until consensus is found. \n\n==== The Delphi procedure ====\n[[File:ResultVisualisationDelphi.png|400px|thumb|right|Questionnaire results for the original RAND study, asking for an estimate of bomb requirements. The estimated numbers per participant converge over the course of the Delphi procedure.

A group of experts \/ stakeholders on a specific issue is identified and invited as participants for the Delphi. These participants represent different backgrounds: academics, government and non-government officials as wel, as practitioners. They should have a diverse set of perspectives and profound knowledge on the discussed issues. They may be grouped based on their organizations, skills, disciplines or qualifications (3). Their number typically ranges from 10 up to 30, depending on the complexity of the issue (2, 3, 5, 6). \n\nThe researchers then develop a questionnaire. It is informed by previous research as well as input from external experts (not the participants) who are asked to contribute knowledge and potential questions on the pertinent issue (2, 5). The amount of [[Glossary|consultation]] depends on the expertise of the researchers on the respective issue (2)."],"18":["'''Transdisciplinary research is of special importance to Sustainability Science and has received immense recognition in this field in the last years.''' This is because \"[s]ustainability is also inherently transdisciplinary\" (Stock & Burton 2011, p.1091), as it builds on the premise of solving real-world problems which are deeply nestled in ecological, political, economic and social processes and structures and therefore cannot be understood and solved without engaging with these spheres (Kates et al. 2015). Transdisciplinary research is a suitable approach for Sustainability Science: it allows to incorporate the knowledge of relevant stakeholders; it considers the normative dimensions involved in societal endeavors (that is, diverging norms, goals and visions of different societal spheres); and it increases [[Glossary|legitimacy]], ownership and accountability for the jointly developed solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Stock & Burton 2011). The integrative transdisciplinary approach highlights systemic interdependencies, enables a better understanding of complex issues and provides better knowledge to develop socially robust and applicable, effective solutions (Lang et al. 2012; Mauser et al. 2015).\n\n\n== How to do TD in Sustainability Science ==\nHere, we will refer to the ideal-typical model presented by Lang et al (2012). It introduces a conceptual guide, structured into three phases, on how transdisciplinary research for sustainability science should ideally be conducted. The relevant steps of each phase as well as general principles for the whole process will be listed below. The presented process is recursive: Problems emerging in scientific as well as societal practice are integrated in the transdisciplinary research approach. After its three phases have been realized, the newly generated knowledge and solutions are re-integrated into these two spheres, where they are applied and consolidated. Ultimately, new challenges emerge that demand renewed transdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n==== The ideal-typical model ====\n[[File:TDmodel.png|500px|thumb|left|'''The ideal-typical model for TD research in Sustainability Science.'''

(2013) remark that the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders involved need to be clarified from the beginning and existent inequalities need to be removed. Further, they comment that integrated research modes demand new methods and concepts, new institutional arrangements, organizational [[Glossary|competencies]] and tailored funding possibilities. The cooperation between science and society requires reflexive learning processes, appropriate communication tools and also needs to reflect on the role of science in the overall endeavour. Also, the authors highlight that there may be inertia to change in the given system which needs to be overcome.\n* Lang et al. (2012) name various issues in the framing of problems (lack of problem awareness, unbalanced problem ownership), processual issues (insufficient legitimacy of the actors involved, conflicting methodological standards, lack of integration (knowledge, structures, [[Glossary|communication)]], discontinuous [[Glossary|participation]]), as well as challenges concerning the development of solutions (ambiguity of results, fear to fail, limited solution options, lack of legitimacy of transdisciplinary outcomes, capitalization on distorted research results, issues when tracking impacts). Also, \"[a]rguing from a more conventional research perspective, scientists might be skeptical with respect to reliability, validity, and other epistemological and methodological aspects of collaborative research (\u2018\u2018credibility\u2019\u2019). Practitioners and stakeholders, on the other hand, might be skeptical regarding the practical relevance of the results (\u2018\u2018salience\u2019\u2019).\" (Lang et al. 2012)\n* Hall & Rourke (2014) expand on communicative challenges, claiming that \"[n]ot all of the challenges that threaten TDSS [transdisciplinary sustainability science] are communication challenges, but communication breakdown can exacerbate any of them. Because of its centrality, care must be taken by collaborators to cultivate a healthy communication dynamic; however, given the many perspectives involved in a typical TDSS project, this will not be easy. These projects meet complex problems with complex responses, entailing the need to remain flexible and responsive to participant requirements and the need to modify the approach if new information and values arise.\" They highlight communicative challenges especially in the framing of problems (exclusion of important perspectives, different views of the problem) and the conduction of the research (unwillingness to share personal perspectives, failure to recognize or articulate differences in individual assumptions, uncertainties and incomplete or incompatible knowledge, limited cognitive abilities to integrated individual partial knowledge).","The interconnectedness of different forms of knowledge; reflexivity of researchers and other actors; the recognition of [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity]] in systems; and the necessity of power relations in knowledge production are prominent examples of current challenges that methodologies as of yet have not solved. We are probably still far away from the creation of a solidified canon of knowledge to solve these riddles. One could argue that we will never solve these methodological problems altogether, but that the joined action and interaction while working on these problems will be the actual solution, and that a real solution as with past methods of normal science shall never be reached. This is unclear to date, yet we need to become aware that when we question the ''status quo'' of knowledge production and methodologies, we may not be looking for goals, but more for a path. There are several examples in sustainability science that follow this path, such as [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinarity]] and [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|system thinking]]. However, according to critical realism, it may be good to solidify innovative and novel methodologies to a point that enables as to take meaningful actions based on the knowledge we create.\n----\n[[Category:Normativity_of_Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"19":["The disciplinary bias of modern science thus creates a deeply normative methodological bias, which some disciplines may try to take into account yet others clearly not. In other words, the dogmatic selection of methods within disciplines has the potential to create deep flaws in empirical research, and we need to be aware and reflexive about this. '''The largest bias concerning methods is the choice of methods per se.''' A critical perspective is thus not only of relevance from a perspective of societal responsibility, but equally from a view on the empirical. Clear documentation and reproducibility of research are important but limited stepping stones in a critique of the methodological. This cannot replace a critical perspective, but only amends it. Empirical knowledge will only look at parts - or strata according to Roy Bhaskar - of reality, yet philosophy can offer a generalisable perspective or theory, and Critical Theory, Critical Realism as well as other current developments of philosophy can be seen as a thriving towards an integrated and holistic philosophy of science, which may ultimately link to an overaching theory of ethics (Parfit). If the empirical and the critical inform us, then both a philosophy of science and ethics may tell us how we may act based on our perceptions of reality.\n\n== Further Information ==\n[https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/critical-theory-3026623 Some words on Critical Theory]<br>\n[https:\/\/www.newworldencyclopedia.org\/entry\/Critical_realism#Contemporary_critical_realism A short entry on critical realism]\n----\n[[Category:Normativity of Methods]]\n\nThe [[Table_of_Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","Coming back to bias, '''Critical Theory seems as an antidote to bias''', and some may argue Critical Realism even more so, as it combines the criticality with a certain humbleness necessary when exploring the empirical and causal. The explanatory characteristic allowed by Critical Realism might be good enough for the pragmatist, the practical may speak to the modern engagement of science with and for society, and the normative is aware of \u2013 well - all things normative, including the critical. Hence a door was opened to a new mode of science, focussing on the situation and locatedness of research within the world. This was surely a head start with Kant, who opened the globe to the world of methods. There is however a critical link in Habermas, who highlighted the duality of the rational individual on a small scale and the role of global societies as part of the economy (Habermas 1987). This underlines a crucial link to the original three foundational theories in philosophy, albeit in a dramatic and focused interpretation of modernity. Habermas himself was well aware of the tensions between these two approaches \u2013 the critical and the empirical -, yet we owe it to Critical Theory and its continuations that a practical and reflexive knowledge production can be conducted within deeply normative systems such as modern democracies. \n\nLinking to the historical development of methods, we can thus clearly claim that Critical Theory (and Critical Realism) opened a new domain or mode of thinking, and its impact can be widely felt way beyond the social science and philosophy that it affected directly. However, coming back to bias, the answer to an almost universal rejection of empiricism will [[Big problems for later|not be followed here]]. Instead, we need to come back to the three foundational theories of philosophy, and need to acknowledge that reason, social contract and utilitarianism are the foundation of the first empirical disciplines that are at their core normative (e.g. psychology, social and political science, and economics). Since bias can be partly related to these three theories, and consequentially to specific empirical disciplines, we need to recognise that there is an overarching methodological bias. This methodological bias has a signature rooted in specific design criteria, which are in turn related to specific disciplines. Consequently, this methodological bias is a disciplinary bias - even more so, since methods may be shared among scientific disciplines, but most disciplines claim either priority or superiority when it comes to the ownership of a method.","of modern research to date will fall into the traditionally established inductive or deductive category. It is therefore not surprising that [[Different_paths_to_knowledge#Critical_Theory_.26_Bias|critical theory]] and other approaches cast doubt over these rigid criteria, and the knowledge they produce. Nevertheless, they represent an important categorisation for the current state of the art of many areas of science, and therefore deserve critical attention, least because many methods imply either one or the other approach."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.\n\nSoft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a 'system' an \"(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world\" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a 'system'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking''' according to Checkland. Source: Checkland 2000, p.18]]\n\nSystem Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: ''System Analysis'' and ''System Dynamics'' (1).","System Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: ''System Analysis'' and ''System Dynamics'' (1).\n\n''System Analysis'' \"(...) is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). ''System Analysis'', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below. For more information, refer to the entry on [[System Analysis]].\n\n''System Dynamics'', then, focuses on the interaction part of the system. It \"(...) refers to the re-creation of the understanding of a system and its feedbacks. It aims at exploring dynamic responses to changes within or from outside the system. (...) System Dynamics deals with mathematical representation of our mental models and is a secondary step after we have developed our mental model.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). System Dynamics, as the name suggests, enables the researcher to observe and measure the behavior of the system. The interactions between the individual elements are not just recreated, but the consequences of these interactions are quantified and assessed.\n\nSystem Thinking allows for a shift in the perception of [[Causality|causality]]. Instead of assuming linear causality (A causes B, B causes C) it allows for the integration of further influencing factors, as well as a more neutral depiction of the system at hand. C may now be seen as a property that [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|emerges]] from the relation between A and B, instead of perceiving it as a direct consequence of B. Haraldsson (2004, p.21) provides an illustrative example here: \"We start by asking the initial question: \"I want to understand how water flows into the glass and what I do to fill it up.\" Instead of looking at the action from an individual point of view, where the \"I am\" is the active part and at the centre of focus, we shift our perception to the structure of the action. The \"I am\" simply becomes a part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. Suddenly we have shifted out attention to the structure of the behavior and we can observe that the structure is causing the behavior. (...) We have now transformed the traditional linear thinking into a circular argument.\"","System Thinking can be applied in any discipline to understand underlying structures and develop models of the system that is analysed. However, sustainability science relies heavily on System Thinking since it acknowledges the complex and lagged interrelationships within and in between ecological, economic, social and further systems. A Key Publication in this field was 'Thinking in Systems' by '''Donella Meadows''', who had been co-authoring the landmark 'Limits to Growth' before. Sustainability Science, which attempts to bridge the world how it is with the world how it ought to be, relies on System Thinking to understand how the world is and in which '[[Glossary|leverage points]]' one needs to intervene to bring about change. System Thinking can also be applied outside of scientific research, e.g. to analyze company-internal processes, for marketing purposes etc. (see e.g. 3)\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nBefore explaining System Thinking, it should first be explained what is a 'system'.\n\n==== Systems, System Thinking, System Analysis & System Dynamics ====\nA system is a \"(...) network of multiple variables that are connected to each other through causal relationships\", based on which the network \"(...) expresses some sort of behaviour, which can only be characterized through observation as a whole\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.11). This behavior remains persistent in a variety of circumstances. More simply put, a system is a \"(...) collection of connected things (...) that influence one another.\" (Toole 2005, p.2) Both the collection of elements and their interactions are important elements of the system which is emphasized by saying that a system is 'more than a collection of its parts' (Arnold & Wade 2015, p.2).\n\nEvery system is \"(...) defined by its boundaries\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.13). The borders we draw for our system analysis influence which level of detail we apply to our view on the system, and which elements we investigate. System elements can be animate (animals, humans) or inanimate (rocks, rain), conceptual (motivation) or real (harvest), quantifiable (money) or rather qualitative (well-being) (2). For example, a system could be a tree, with the leaves, the stem and such elements interacting with each other, but also the forest in which our tree interacts with the soil, the weather, other plants, animals and inanimate objects. The system could also be the globe, where this forest interacts with other ecosystems, or the system in which Planet Earth interacts with the rest of the universe - our solar system.

This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:","== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# '''Select the topic you want to learn more about.''' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don't go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain \"Economics\" or \"Physics\" in one go.\n# '''Find someone to talk to'''. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don't have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# '''Make notes.''' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and\/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# '''Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.''' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it. Congratulations!","== The way forward ==\n[https:\/\/www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu\/ The Feynman lectures] provide the most famous textbook volumes on physics. Richard Feynman and his coauthors compiled these books in the 1960, yet to this day, many consider these volumes to be the most concise and understandable introduction to physics. Granted, Feynman's work is brilliant. '''At the same time, however, this fact also means that in the 1960s the majority of the knowledge necessary for an introduction in physics was already available.''' While we may consider that much happened ever since, students can still use these textbooks today. Something similar can be claimed for basic statistics, although it should be noted that physics is a scientific discipline, while statistics is a scientific method. Some disciplines use different methods, and many disciplines use statistics as a method. However, the final word on statistics has not been said, as the differences between [[A matter of probability|probability]] statistics and [[Bayesian Inference|Bayesian]] statistics are not yet deeply explored. Especially Bayesian statistics may provide a vital link to experiments, yet this has been hardly explored to date. Critical spirits may say that the teaching of statistics is often the most normal part of any sort of normal science study program, and this reputation led to statistics more often than not being characterized by a lack of excitement for students. We should not only know and teach the basics, but also engage in the discussion what these all may mean.\n \n'''Philosophy can be thought together well with statistics.''' Unfortunately until today they are not very much associated with each other.\nSomething surprisingly similar can be said about philosophy. While much of the basic principles are known, these are hardly connected. Philosophy hence works ever deeper on specifics, but most of its contributors move away from a unified line of thinking. This is what makes Derek Parfits work stand out, since he tried to connect the different dots, and it will be the work of the next decades to come to build on his work, and improve it if necessary."],"22":["==Fixed effects vs. Random effects==\n[[File:Smoking trooper.jpg|thumb|right|If smoking is a fixed or a random effect depends on the study design]]\nWithin [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical standpoint the value of such pre-tests may be limited at best.","When designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results. Subsequently, ANOVA experiments became more complex, combining several independent variables and also allowing to correct for so called random factors, which are elements for which the variance is calculated out of the ANOVA model. This allows for instance to increase the sample size to minimise the effects of the variance in an agricultural experiment which is being conducted on several agricultural fields. In this example, agricultural fields are then included as block factor, which allows to minimise the variance inferred by these replications. Hence, the variance of the agricultural fields is tamed by a higher number of replicates. This led to the ANOVA becoming one of the most relevant methods in statistics, yet recent developments such as the reproducibility crisis in psychology highlight that care needs to be taken to not overplay ones hand. Preregistering hypotheses and more recognition of the [[Limitations of Statistics|limitations]] of such designs currently pave a path towards a more critical future of statistical designs. \n\nAnother development that emerged during the last decades is the conducting of so called real-world experiments, which are often singular case studies with interventions, yet typically less or no control of variables. These approaches are slowly being developed in diverse branches of research, and allow to open a [[Meta-Analysis|meta-analytical]] dimension, where a high number of case studies is averaged in terms of the research results. The combination of different studies enables a different perspective, yet currently such approaches are either restricted to rigid clinical trials or to meta-analyses with more variables than cases. \n\nReal-world experiments are thus slowly emerging to bridge experimental rigour with the often perceived messiness of the problems we face and how we engage with them as researchers, knowing that one key answer involving these is the joint learning together with stakeholders. This development may allow us to move one step further in current [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|systems thinking]], where still many phenomena we cannot explained are simply labeled as complex. We will have to acknowledge in the future which phenomena we may begin to understand in the future, and which phenomena we may never be able to fully understand. [[Non-equilibrium dynamics|Non-equilibrium theory]] is an example where unpredictable dynamics can still be approaches by a scientific theory. Chaos theory is another example, where it is clear that we may not be able to grasp the dynamics we investigate in a statistical sense, yet we may be able to label dynamics as chaotic and allow a better understanding of our own limitations. Complexity is somewhat inbetween, leaning partly towards the explainable, yet also having stakes in the unexplainable dynamics we face. '''Statistics is thus at a crossroad, since we face the limitations of our approaches, and have to become better in taking these into account.'''","[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U Fixed vs. Random Effects]: A differentiation\n----\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n[[Category:R examples]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"23":["Field experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields.

This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of. In other words, we sacrifice robustness with our ever increasing wish for more complicated designs in statistics. Our ambition in modern research thus came with a price, and a clear documentation is one antidote how we might cure the flaws we introduced through  our ever more complicated experiments.

These approaches are slowly being developed in diverse branches of research, and allow to open a [[Meta-Analysis|meta-analytical]] dimension, where a high number of case studies is averaged in terms of the research results. The combination of different studies enables a different perspective, yet currently such approaches are either restricted to rigid clinical trials or to meta-analyses with more variables than cases. \n\nReal-world experiments are thus slowly emerging to bridge experimental rigour with the often perceived messiness of the problems we face and how we engage with them as researchers, knowing that one key answer involving these is the joint learning together with stakeholders. This development may allow us to move one step further in current [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|systems thinking]], where still many phenomena we cannot explained are simply labeled as complex. We will have to acknowledge in the future which phenomena we may begin to understand in the future, and which phenomena we may never be able to fully understand. [[Non-equilibrium dynamics|Non-equilibrium theory]] is an example where unpredictable dynamics can still be approaches by a scientific theory. Chaos theory is another example, where it is clear that we may not be able to grasp the dynamics we investigate in a statistical sense, yet we may be able to label dynamics as chaotic and allow a better understanding of our own limitations. Complexity is somewhat inbetween, leaning partly towards the explainable, yet also having stakes in the unexplainable dynamics we face. '''Statistics is thus at a crossroad, since we face the limitations of our approaches, and have to become better in taking these into account.'''","There are many facets that could be highlighted under such a provocative heading. Since Larry Laudan, it has become clear that the assumption that developments of science which are initiated by scientists are reasonable, is a myth at best. Take the example of one dominating [[Glossary|paradigm]] in science right now: Publish or perish. This paradigm highlights the current culture dominating most parts of science. If you do not produce a large amount of peer-reviewed publications, your career will not continue. This created quite a demand on statistics as well, and the urge to arrive at significant results that probably created frequent violations of Occam's razor (that is, things should be as complex as necessary, but as simple as possible). The reproducibility crisis in psychology is one example of these developments, yet all other disciplines building on statistics struggle to this end, too. Another problem is the fact that with this [[Questioning the status quo in methods|ever-increasing demand for \"scientific innovation\"]], models evolve, and it is hard to catch up. '''Thus, instead of having robust and parsimonious models, there are more and more unsuitable and overcomplicated models.''' The level of statistics at an average certainly increased. There are counter-examples where this is not necessarily the case, and rightly so. In medicine, for instance, the canon of statistics is fairly established and solidified for large parts of the research landscape. Thus, while many innovative publications are exploring new ways of statistics, and a highly innovative to this end, there is always a well-defined set of statistical methods that research can default on. Within many other branches of science, however, there is a certain increase in errors or at least slippery slopes. Statistics are part of the publish or perish, and with this pressure still rising, unreasonable actions in the application of statistics may still increase. Many other examples exist to this end, but this should highlight that statistics is not only still developing further, but statistics should also keep evolving, otherwise we may not be able the diversity of epistemological knowledge it can offer.\n\n== The imperfection of measurements ==\nAs a next step, let us look at the three pillars of Western ethics and how these are intertwined with statistics. We all discuss how we act reasonable, how we can maximize our happiness and how we live together as people. Hence reason, utilitarianism and the social contract are all connected to statistics in one way or the other. While this complicated relation may in the future be explored in more than a short wiki entry, lets focus on some examples here."],"24":["===== ''Please note further'' =====\n* The flashlight can be used as a starting round or energizer in between.\n* The team leader should be aware of good timing, usefulness at this point, and the setting for the flashlight. \n* The method is quick and efficient, and allows every participant to voice their own point without interruption.

Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution.","Depending on the existence of random variables, there is a distinction between Mixed Effect Models, and Generalised Linear Models based on regressions.\n\n<imagemap>Image:Statistics Flowchart - GLM random variables.png|650px|center|\npoly 289 4 153 141 289 270 422 137 [[An_initial_path_towards_statistical_analysis#Generalised_Linear_Models]]\npoly 139 151 3 288 139 417 272 284 [[Mixed Effect Models]]\npoly 439 149 303 286 439 415 572 282 [[Generalized Linear Models]]\n<\/imagemap>\n\n'''How do I know?'''\n* Random variables introduce extra variability to the model.

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting. Therefore we need to check if our dataset only includes numbers and then transform our dataset into a matrix, using <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>as.matrix()<\/syntaxhighlight> function.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata(\"mtcars\")\nmatcars <- as.matrix(mtcars)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nAlso, for better representation, we are going to rename the columns, giving them their full names. It is not a mandatory step, but it makes our heatmap more comprehensible.","==Explanation of used arguments==\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Colv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Rowv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> are used to remove the dendrograms from rows and columns. A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects and is added on top of the heatmap by default if the argument is not specified. The main reason for removing it here is that it is a different method of data visualisation which is not mandatory for the heatmap representation and requires a separate article to review it fully.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>scale = \u201ccolumn\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to normalize the columns of the matrix (to absorb the variation between columns). As it was stated previously, normalization is needed due to the algorithm by which the colors are set. Here in our dataset, the values of features \u201cGross horsepower\u201d and \u201cDisplacement\u201d are much larger than the rest. Therefore, without normalization, these two columns will be all marked approximately equally high and all the other columns equally low. Normalizing means that we keep the relative values in each column but not the real numbers. In the interpretation sense it means that, for example, the same color of features \u201cMiles per Gallon\u201d and \u201cNumber of Cylinders\u201d of Mazda RX4 does not mean that the actual values are the same or approximately the same (placed in the same bin). It only means that the relative values of each of these cells in corresponding columns are the same or are in the same bin.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>margins<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to fit the columns and rows names into the graph. The reason we used it here is because of the renaming of the columns, which is resulted in longer names that did not fit well by themselves.\n\nColoring options for the heatmap\nThe choice of color for the heatmap is one of the most important aspects of creating an understandable and nice-looking representation of the data. If you do not specify the color (as in the example above) then the default color palette will be applied. However, you can use the argument <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>col<\/syntaxhighlight> and choose from a wide variety of palettes for coloring your heatmap.","<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfullcolnames <- c(\"Miles per Gallon\", \"Number of Cylinders\",\n                  \"Displacement\", \"Horsepower\", \"Rear Axle Ratio\",\n                  \"Weight\", \"1\/4 Mile Time\", \"Engine\", \"Transmission\",\n                  \"Number of Gears\", \"Number of Carburetors\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we are using the transformed dataset (matcars) to create the heatmap. Other used arguments are explained below.\n[[File:Heatmap.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\nheatmap(matcars, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, \n        scale = \"column\", labCol = fullcolnames, \n        margins = c(11,5))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n== How to interpret a heatmap? ==\n\nIn the default color palette the interpretation is usually the following: the darker the color the higher the responding value, and vice versa. For example, let\u2019s look at the feature <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>\u201cNumber of Carburetors\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight>. We can see that '''Maserati Bora''' has the darkest color, hence it has the largest number of carburetors, followed by '''Ferrari Dino''', which has the second-largest number of carburetors. While other models such as '''Fiat X1-9''' or '''Toyota''' have the lightest colors. It means that they have the lowest numbers of carburetors. This interpretation can be applied to every other column."],"27":["Many concrete steps brought us closer to the concrete application of scientific methods, among them - notably - the approach of controlled testing by the Arabian mathematician and astronomer [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a.

Of course Alhazen stands here only as one of many that formed the rise of science on '''the Islamic world during medieval times, which can be seen as a cradle of Western science, and also as a continuity from the antics, when in Europe much of the immediate Greek and Roman heritage was lost.'''\n\n==== Before Enlightenment - ''Measure And Solve'' ====\n[[File:Normal_Mercator_map_85deg.jpg|thumb|300px|left|'''Mercator world map.'''

The real breakthrough was the [[Geographical Information Systems|Mercator map]], which was - restricted to the knowledge at the time - the first map that enabled a clear navigation across the oceans, enabling colonialism and Western dominions and domination of the world. This is insofar highly relevant for methods, because it can be argued that the surplus from the colonies and distant countries was one of the main drivers of the thriving of the European colonial rulers, their economies and consequently, their science.

'''By observing nature and its phenomena, we are able to derive conclusion based on the particular.''' Bacon is thus often coined to be the father of 'the scientific method', an altogether misleading term, as there are many scientific methods. However, empiricism, meaning the empirical investigation of phenomena and the derivation of results or even rules triggered a scientific revolution, and also a specialization of different scientific branches. While Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had been a polymath less than a century ago, Bacon (1561-1626) triggered an increase in empirical inquiry that led to the deeper formation of scientific disciplines. Many others contributed to this development: [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/locke\/ Locke] claimed that human knowledge builds on experience, and [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/hume\/ Hume] propelled this into skepticism, casting the spell of doubt on anything that is rooted in belief or dogma. By questioning long standing knowledge, science kicked in - among other things - the door of god himself, a circumstance that is too large to be presented here in any sense. What is important however is that - starting from the previous age of diverse approaches to knowledge - the combination of empiricism on the one end, and the associated philosophical developments on the other end, the age of reason had dawned.\n\n[[File:Timeline of methods V2.jpg|600px|frame|center|'''A timeline of major breakthroughs in science.'''

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

They are a bit over simplistic if they contain only one level of information such as three groups and their abundance, and can be more advanced if they contain two levels of information such as in stacked barplots. These can be shown as either absolute numbers or proportions, which may make a dramatic difference for the analysis or interpretation.\n\n'''Correlation plots''' ('xyplots') are the next staple in statistical graphics and most often the graphical representation of a correlation. Further, often also a regression is implemented to show effect strengths and variance. Fitting a [[Regression Analysis|regression]] line is often the most important visual aid to showcase the trend. Through point size or color can another information level be added, making this a really powerful tool, where one needs to keep a keen eye on the relation between correlation and causality. Such plots may also serve to show fluctuations in data over time, showing trends within data as well as harmonic patterns.\n\n'''Boxplots''' are the last in what I would call the trinity of statistical figures. Showing the variance of continuous data across different factor levels is what these plots are made of.

Histograms are used for getting a sense about the distribution of data, its median, and skewness.","How can you represent this data as concise and understandable as possible? It is impossible to plot all variables as is onto a flat screen\/paper. Furthermore, high-dimensional data suffers from what is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features \/ dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. '''Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem'''.\n[[File: PCA_BiPlot.png|center|500px]]\n\n== What the method does ==\nPrinciple Component Analysis is one of the foundational methods to combat the curse of dimensionality. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm whose goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, condensing its entirety down to a low number of dimensions (also called principle components, usually two or three). \n\nAlthough it comes with a cost of losing some information, it makes data visualization much easier, improves the space and time complexity required for machine learning algorithms tremendously, and allows for more intuitive intepretation of these models. PCA can also be categorized a feature extraction techniques, since it creates these principle components - new and more relevant features - from the original ones.\n\nThe essence of PCA lies in finding all directions in which the data \"spreads\", determining the extent in which the data spreads in those directions, keeping only few direction in which the data spreads the most. And voila, these are your new dimensions \/ features of the data.\n\n=== Road to PCA ===\n==== Standardization ====\nOftentimes the features in the data are measured on different scales. This step makes sure that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Otherwise, variables with large range will trump thoses with smaller range (for example: a time variable that ranges between 0ms and 1000ms with dominate over a distance variable that ranges between 0m and 10m). Each variable can be scaled by subtracting its mean and dividing by the standard deviation (this is the same as calculating the z-score, and in the end, all variables with have the same mean 0 and standard deviation of 1).\n\n==== Covariance matrix ===="],"29":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Machine Learning techniques perform very well - sometimes better than humans- on variety of tasks (eg. detecting cancer from x-ray images, playing chess, art authentication, etc.)\n* In a variety of situations where outcomes are noisy, Machine Learning models perform better than rule-based models.\n* Even though many methods in the field of Machine Learning have been researched quite extensively, the techniques still suffer from a lack of interpretability and explainability.\n* Reproducibility crisis is a big problem in the field of Machine Learning research as highlighted in [6].\n* Machine Learning approaches have been criticized as being a \"brute force\" approach of solving tasks.\n* Machine Learning techniques only perform well when the dataset size is large.

Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.\n\nAlso, each scientific method that is described on this Wiki is categorized according to the Wiki's underlying [[Design Criteria of Methods]].<br\/>\n'''This means that each method fulfills one or more categories of each of the following criteria:'''\n<br\/>\n* [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] - [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n* [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] - [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n* Spatial scales: [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] - [[:Category:System|System]] - [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n* Temporal scales: [[:Category:Past|Past]] - [[:Category:Present|Present]] - [[:Category:Future|Future]]\nYou can click on each category for more information and all the entries that belong to this category.\n<br\/>","== What are scientific methods? ==\nGenerally speaking, ''scientific methods create knowledge''. This knowledge creation process follows certain principles and has a certain rigour. Knowledge that is created through scientific methods should be ideally [https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/scientific-reproducibility\/ ''reproducible''], which means that someone else under the given circumstances would come up with the same insights when using the same respective methods. This is insofar important, as other people would maybe create different data under a similar setting, but all the data should answer research questions or hypotheses in the same way. However, there are some methods that may create different knowledge patterns, which is why documentation is pivotal in the application of scientific methods. Some forms of knowledge, such as the perception of individuals, cannot be reproduced, because these are singular perspectives. '''Knowledge created through scientific methods hence either follows a systematic application of methods, or a systematic documentation of the application of methods'''. Reproducible approaches create the same knowledge, and other approaches should be equally well documented to safeguard that for all steps taken it can be understood what was being done precisely. \n\nAnother possibility to define methods concerns the different stages of research in which they are applied. '''Methods are about gathering data, analysing data, and interpreting data.''' Not all methods do all of these three steps, in fact most methods are even exclusive to one or two of these steps. For instance, one may analyse [[Semi-structured Interview|structured interviews]] - which are one way to gather data - with statistical tests, which are a form of analysis. The interpretation of the results is then built around the design of the interviews, and there are norms and much experience concerning the interpretation of statistical tests. Hence, gathering data, analysing it, and then interpreting the results are part of a process that we call ''design criteria of methods''. Established methods often follow certain more or less established norms, and the norms can be broken down into the main design criteria of methods. Let us have a look at these.","The course '''Scientific methods - Different paths to knowledge''' introduces the learner to the fundamentals of scientific work. It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances."],"32":["[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you.

The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative [[Glossary|assumptions]] that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the context of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.\n\n== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having \"no mind\", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you.

The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|'''MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters\/bubbles, as in this example.''' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols. Source: [https:\/\/www.thetutorteam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/shutterstock_712786150.jpg thetutorteam.com]]]\n\n'''A Mindmap enables the visual arrangement of various types of information, including tasks, key concepts, important topics, names and more.''' It allows for a quick overview of all relevant information items on a topic at a glance. It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings. A Mindmap can also be a good tool for a [[Glossary|brainstorming]] process, since it does not focus too much on the exact relationships between the visualised elements, but revolves around a more intuitive approach of arranging information.","== What the method does ==\nGroup Concept Mapping is a '''structured, linear group-based approach of gathering conceptual elements, arranging and rating them, and creating visual representations'''. The end result is typically a map or similar form of visual representation, which displays the ideas and how they relate to each other. This visualisation, as suggested by Trochim 1989, can serve as a baseline for a subsequent planning or evaluation process. An important feature is the focus on the group of actors who create the concept map on their own, supported by the methodological process and a facilitator. The end result is based on their own contributions, represents their own understanding of the issue at hand, and can thus more easily be used by them for the following processes.\n\n=== Differences to Concept Mapping and Mindmaps ===\n[[Concept Maps]] refer to visual representations of conceptual ideas, as introduced by Novak and colleagues in the 1970s (Trochim 1989). Information (words or short sentences) is put into boxes or circles, which are connected in a network-like structure through arrows. This is in a way comparable to a mindmap. However, [[Mindmap|Mindmaps]] do not serve the purpose of presenting a final, comprehensive overview over a specific focus on a topic, but rather an unstructured, spontaneous collection of general related ideas around one key term. Both processes - Concept Maps and Mindmaps - can be done by a single person or in a group. For example, Brown (2003) shows how group-based creation of a concept map can enhance biology teaching.\n\nBy comparison, '''Group Concept Mapping is not a mere group-based creation of a Concept Map''', but an established methodological approach which includes qualitative and quantitative elements, and can be seen as a mixed methods approach in itself, with both elements of data gathering and analysis. It is a structured form of framework development, in which ideas, thoughts, goals, needs and resources relevant to a specific topic are collected, conceptually linked, quantitatively evaluated and presented in a map-like visualisation. \n\n=== The process of Group Concept Mapping ===\nGroup Concept Mapping typically consists of six linear steps (see figure): Preparation, Statement Generation, Structuring, Representation, Interpretation, Utilization. Below, we will elaborate on each step based on the original methodological design by Trochim (1989), and present the process as done in the exemplary study by McCaffrey et al. (2019), who attempted to generate a conceptual model of good health care from the perspective of patients.\n\n[[File:Group Concept Mapping - Visualisation-2.png|600px|thumb|center|'''The process of Group Concept Mapping'''.

Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.","While psychology, medicine, agricultural science, biology and later ecology thus thrived in their application of experimental designs and studies, there was also an increasing recognition of information that was creating [[Bias and Critical Thinking|biases]] or otherwise falsely skewed the results. '''The ANOVA hence became amended by additional modifications, ultimately leading to more advanced statistics that were able to focus on diverse statistical effects''', and reduce the influence of skews rooted, for instance, in sampling bias, statistical bias or other flaws. Hence, [[Mixed-Effect Models]] became an advanced next step in the history of statistical models, leading to more complex statistical designs and experiments, taking more and more information into account. In addition, meta-analytical approaches led to the combination and summarising of several case studies into a systematic overview. This was the dawn of a more integrational understanding of different studies that were combined into a [[Meta-Analysis]], taking different contexts of the numerous studies into account as well. In addition, research also focused more and more onto a deeper understanding of individual case studies, with a stronger emphasis on the specific context of the respective case. Such singular cases have been of value in medical research for decades now, where new challenges or solutions are frequently published despite the obvious lack of a wider contribution. Such medical case studies report novel findings, emerging problems or other so far unknown case dynamics, and often serve as a starting point for further research. Out of such diverse origins such as [[System Thinking & Causal Loop Diagrams|system thinking]], Urban Research, [[Ethnography]] and other fields in research, [[Living Labs & Real World Laboratories|real world experiments]] emerged, which take place in everyday social or cultural settings. The rigid designs of laboratory or field experiments is traded off for a deeper understanding of the specific context and case. While real world experiments emerged some decades ago already, they are only starting to gain wider recognition. All the while, the reproducibility crisis challenges the classical laboratory and field experiments, as a wider recognition that many results - for instance from psychological studies - cannot be reproduced. All this indicates that while much of our scientific knowledge is derived from experiments, much remains to be known, also about the conduct of experiments themselves.\n\n----\n[[Category: Normativity_of_Methods]]\n[[Category: Methods]]\n[[Category: Statistics]]\n[[Category: Qualitative]]\n[[Category: Deductive]]\n[[Category: Individual]]\n[[Category: System]]\n[[Category: Global]]\n[[Category: Present]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden.","W\u00e4hrend Psychologie, Medizin, Agrarwissenschaft, Biologie und sp\u00e4ter auch die \u00d6kologie auf diese Weise in der Anwendung von Versuchspl\u00e4nen und Studien gediehen, gab es auch eine zunehmende Anerkennung von Informationen, die [[Bias and Critical Thinking|Bias]] erzeugten oder die Ergebnisse anderweitig verzerrten.

Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.\n\nOften, these models serve as a baseline for the whole scheme of analysis, and thus already help researchers to design and plan their whole data campaign. Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know.","==  Normativity ==\nMixed Effect Models are the gold standard when it comes to reducing complexities into constructs, for better or worse. All variables that go into a Mixed Effect Model are normative choices, and these choices matter deeply. First of all, many people struggle to decide which variables are about fixed variance, and which variables are relevant as random variance. Second, how are these variables constructed - are they continuous or categorical, and if the latter, what is the reasoning behind the category levels? Designing Mixed Effect Modell studies is thus definitely a part of advanced statistics, and this is even harder when it comes to integrating non-designed datasets into a Mixed Effect Model [[Glossary|framework]]. Care and experience are needed to evaluate sample sizes, variance across levels and variables. This brings us to the most crucial point: Model inspection.\n\n'''Mixed Effect Models are built on a litany of preconditions, most of which most researchers choose to conveniently ignore.''' In my experience, this is more often than not ok, because it does not matter. Mixed Effect Models are - bless the maximum likelihood estimation - very sturdy. It is hard to find a model that does not have some predictive or explanatory value, even if hardly any pre-conditions are met. Still, this does not mean that we should ignore these. In order to sleep safe and sound at night, I am almost obsessed with model inspection, checking variance across levels, looking at the residuals, and looking for gaps and flaws in the model's fit. We should be really conservative to this end, because by focusing on fixed and random variance, we potentiate things that could go wrong. As I said, more often than not, this is not the case, but I propose to be super conservative when it comes to your model outcome. In order to get there, we need yet another thing: Model simplification.","== Outlook ==\nIn terms of Mixed Effect Models, language barriers and the norms of specific disciplines are rather strong. Explaining the basics of these advanced statistics to colleagues is an art in itself, just as the experience of researchers being versatile in [[Semi-structured Interview|Interview]]s cannot be reduced into a few hours of learning. Education in science needs to tackle this head on, and stop teaching statistics that are outdated and hardly published. I suggest that at least on a Master's level, in the long run, all students from the quantitative domain should be able to understand the preconditions and benefits of Mixed Effect Models, but this is something for the distant future. Today, PhD students being versatile in Mixed Effect Models are still outliers. Let us all hope that this statement will be outdated rather sooner than later. Mixed Effect Models are surely powerful and quite adaptable, and are increasingly becoming a part of normal science. Honouring the complexity of the world while still deriving value statements based on statistical analyses has never been more advanced on a broader scale. '''Still, statisticians need to recognize the limitations of real world data, and researchers utilising these need to honour the preconditions and pitfalls of these analyses'''. Current science is in my perception far away from reporting reproducible analyses, meaning that one and the same dataset will be differently analysed by Mixed Effect Model approaches, partly based on experience, partly based on differences between disciplines, and probably also because of many other factors. Mixed Effect Models need to be consolidated and unified, which would make normale science probably better than ever.\n\n== Key Publications ==\n----\n[[Category:Quantitative]]\n[[Category:Inductive]]\n[[Category:Deductive]]\n[[Category:Individual]]\n[[Category:System]]\n[[Category:Global]]\n[[Category:Past]]\n[[Category:Present]]\n[[Category:Future]]\n[[Category:Methods]]\n[[Category:Statistics]]\n\nThe [[Table of Contributors|author]] of this entry is Henrik von Wehrden."],"36":["The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values.","== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches.","Once you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis. \n\nWithin inductive analysis it is less clear how to proceed best. Technically, one can only proceed based on AIC values. Again, there is a brute force approach that boils the maximum model down based on permutations of all combinations. However, this approach can be again considered to be statistical fishing, since no clear hypothesis are tested. While an AIC driven approach failsafes against the worst dangers of statistical fishing, it is clear that if you have no questions, then you also have no answers. Hence a purely inductive analysis does not really make sense, yet you can find the inner relations and main patterns of the dataset regardless of your approach, may it bee inductive or deductive. \n\nDeep down, any given dataset should reveal the same results based on this rigid analysis pathway and framework. However, the scientific community developed different approaches, and there are diverse schools of thinking, which ultimately leads to different approaches being out there. Different analysts may come up with different results. This exemplifies that statistics are not fully unleashed yet, but are indeed still evolving, and not necessarily about reproducible analysis. Keep that in mind when you read analysis, and be conservative in your own analysis. Keep no stone unturned, and go down any rabbit hole you can find."],"37":["The simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant.","The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure.

In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.\n\nNarrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006). \n\nNarrative Research is \"(...) the study of stories\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus \"(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.\" (Moen 2006, p.56). The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014).","'''One common approach in Narrative Research is the usage of narratives in form of spoken or written text or other types of media as the data material for analysis.''' This understanding is comparable to [[Content Analysis]] or [[Hermeneutics]]. A second understanding focuses on the creation of narratives as part of the methodological design, so that the narrative material is not pre-developed but emerges from the inquiry itself (Squire et al. 2014, Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000). In both approaches, 'narrative' is the underlying \"frame of reference\" (Moen 2006, p.57) for the research. An example for the latter understanding is the 'Narrative Interview'.\n\n==== Narrative Interviews ====\n[[File:Narrative Research Phases.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Basic phases of the narrative Interview.''' Source: Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.5.]]\n\nThe Narrative Interview is an Interview format that \"(...) encourages and stimulates an interviewee (...) to tell a story about some significant event in their life and social context.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.3). 'Narrative Interviewing' \"is considered a form of unstructured, in-depth interview with specific features.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.4) To this end, it is a form of the [[Open Interview]], which - compared to [[Semi-structured Interview|Semi-structured]] and [[Survey|Structured Interviews]] - is relatively free from deductively pre-developed question schemata: \"To elicit a less imposed and therefore more 'valid' rendering of the informant's perspective, the influence of the interviewer should be minimal (...) '''The [Narrative Interview] goes further than any other interview method in avoiding pre-structuring the interview.''' (...) It uses a specific type of everyday communication, namely story-telling and listening, to reach this objective.\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.4) Here, it is central that the interviewer appreciate the interviewee's perspective, by using the subject's language and by posing \"as someone who knows nothing or very little about the story being told, and who has no particular interests related to it\" (ibid, p.5). The interview is then transcribed and analyzed using different forms of coding (see Content Analysis), with a focus on the narrative elements.

One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the patterns that are being modeled. '''In other words, GAMs are able to increase the model fit or predictive power, but in the worst case, we are throwing our means to understand or explain the existing relations out of the window.''' \n\nUnder this spell, over the last decades, parts of the statistical modelling wandered more strongly into the muddy waters of superior model fit, yet understood less and less about the underlying mechanisms. Modern science has to date not sufficiently engaged with the questions how predictive modelling can lead to optimific results, and which role our lack of explicit understanding play in terms of worse outcomes. Preventing a pandemic based on a predictive model is surely good, but enforcing a space shuttle start when there is some lack of understanding of the new conditions at launch day led to the Challenger disaster. '''Many disasters of human history were a lack of understanding the unexpected.''' When our experience was pushed into the new realms of the previously unknown, and our expactation of the likelihood of such an extreme event happening was low, the impending surprise often came at a high price. Many developments - global change, increasing system [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|complexity,]] growing inequalities - may further decrease our ability to anticipate infrequent dynamics. This calls for a shift towards maximizing the resilience of our models that may be needed under future circumstances. While this has been highlighted i.e. by the IPCC, the Stockholm resilience center and many other institutions, policy makers are hardly prepared enough, which became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n== The world can (not) be predicted ==\nFrom a predictive or explanatory viewpoint, we can break the world of statistics down into three basic types of dynamics: Linear dynamics, periodical dynamics, and non-linear dynamics. Let us differentiate between these three.","== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution."],"40":["==2. Poisson Distribution==\nPoisson Distribution is one of the discrete probability distributions along with binomial, hypergeometric, and geometric distributions. The following table differentiates what applies where.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Distribution !! Definition\n|-\n| Binomial || It is used when there are two possible outcomes (success\/failure) in a process that are independent of each other in n number of trials. The easiest example is a coin toss whereas a more practical use of binomial distribution is testing a drug, whether the drug cures the disease or not in n number of trials\n|-\n| Hypergeometric || It calculates the number of k successes in n number of trials where the probability of success changes with each passing trial. This kind of distribution applies in Poker when drawing a red card from the deck changes the probability of drawing another red card after it.\n|-\n| Poisson || It provides the probability of an event happening a certain number of times (k) within a given interval of time or space. For example, figuring out the probability of disease occurrence m times in the next month given that it occurs n times in 1 year.\n|-\n| Geometric || It determines the number of independent trials needed to get the first successful outcome. Geometric distribution may be used to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a certain decision in a business.\n|}\n\nPoisson distribution can only be used under three conditions: 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.\n\nFor example, Poisson distribution is used by mobile phone network companies to calculate their performance indicators like efficiency and customer satisfaction ratio. The number of network failures in a week in a locality can be measured given the history of network failures in a particular time duration. This predictability prepares the company with proactive solutions and customers are warned in advance.

Calculation and Probability Mass Function (PMF) Graph==\n\n===Probability Mass Function Graph===\n\n''The Poisson distribution probability mass function (pmf) gives the probability of observing k events in a period given the length of the period and the average events per time.''\n\n[[File:1 equation.PNG|center|250px]]\nT = Time interval \ne = natural logarithmic base \nk = number of events \nThe K! means K factorial. This means that we multiply all integers from K down to 1. Say K is 4 then K!= 4* 3* 2* 1= 24","3. A converse in Raikov\u2019s theorem says that if the sum of two independent random variables is Poisson distributed, then so are each of those two independent random variables Poisson distributed.\n\nConsider the example of radioactive decay for long-lived isotopes, in a radioactive sample containing a large number of nuclei, each of which has a tiny probability of decaying during some time interval, T. Let\u2019s say the rate of decay is 0.31 decay\/second and is monitored for 10 seconds. That gives us the \u03bb1 0.31 * 10 = 3.1 which means the probability equals,\n[[File:3 equation.PNG|center]]\nConsider another example where \u03bb2 is 2.7, the probability is\n[[File:4 equation.PNG|center]]\n\nTherefore,\n'''If we look at the total number k = k1 + k2 of a radioactive decay in a time T, the result is also a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 -> \u03bb = 3.1 + 2.7 = 5.8 : P(k, \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 )'''\n[[File:5 equation.PNG|center]]\n\n''If we have two independent Poisson-distributed variables, their sum is Poisson distributed too.''\n\n4. The skewness is measured by 1\/\u221a\u03bb\n\n5. Excess kurtosis is measured by 1\/\u03bb. See the difference between excess kurtosis and kurtosis [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/excesskurtosis.asp here]. In a nutshell, excess kurtosis compares the kurtosis of the distribution with the kurtosis of a normal distribution and can therefore tell you if an (extreme) event is more or less likely in this case than if the distribution followed a normal distribution.\n\n6. Poisson Limit Theorem states that Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, under certain conditions. When the value of n (number of trials) in a binomial distribution is large and the value of p (probability of success) is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution i.e., n -> \u221e and \u03bb = np, rate parameter, \u03bb is defined as the number of trials, n, in binomial distribution multiplied by the probability of success, p.","The resulting pmf confirms that the closest integer value to lamba i.e., 3 has the most number of years out of 10,000 meaning most years will have 3 duststorms. You can also see that the data is slightly skewed to the right since there is a larger variance to the right than to the left. Looking at the distribution, it looks fairly normally distributed. However, the low lambda does not allow to use the Poisson distribution as an approximation for a normal distribution. Most probably, the large dataset allows us to see it as a normal distribution, since most distributions converge to a normal distribution with increasing sample size.\n==6.

It is impossible to plot all variables as is onto a flat screen\/paper. Furthermore, high-dimensional data suffers from what is called the curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features \/ dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. '''Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem'''.\n[[File: PCA_BiPlot.png|center|500px]]\n\n== What the method does ==\nPrinciple Component Analysis is one of the foundational methods to combat the curse of dimensionality. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm whose goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, condensing its entirety down to a low number of dimensions (also called principle components, usually two or three). \n\nAlthough it comes with a cost of losing some information, it makes data visualization much easier, improves the space and time complexity required for machine learning algorithms tremendously, and allows for more intuitive intepretation of these models. PCA can also be categorized a feature extraction techniques, since it creates these principle components - new and more relevant features - from the original ones.\n\nThe essence of PCA lies in finding all directions in which the data \"spreads\", determining the extent in which the data spreads in those directions, keeping only few direction in which the data spreads the most. And voila, these are your new dimensions \/ features of the data.\n\n=== Road to PCA ===\n==== Standardization ====\nOftentimes the features in the data are measured on different scales. This step makes sure that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Otherwise, variables with large range will trump thoses with smaller range (for example: a time variable that ranges between 0ms and 1000ms with dominate over a distance variable that ranges between 0m and 10m). Each variable can be scaled by subtracting its mean and dividing by the standard deviation (this is the same as calculating the z-score, and in the end, all variables with have the same mean 0 and standard deviation of 1).\n\n==== Covariance matrix ====","[[File: PCA_BiPlotNoScale.png|center|500px]]\n\n[[File: PCA_ContribPlotNoScale.png|center|500px]]\n\nSuddenly all that matters are only the carbohydrate, moisture and fat level of the pizzas. Why is that the case?\n\nBy plotting the distribution of the original data using boxplots (on the left), we can see that the value range of data for the variables are vastly different. For example, the variable carbohydrates has much higher mean and variance compared to calories. By nature, PCA tries to form PCs where there is a widest spread in the data, so it will always prefer those variables with high \"absolute\" variance. It's like comparing 1000 milliseconds and 5 kilometers and putting more weight on the 1000 milliseconds because 1000 is bigger than 5.\n\n[[File: PCA_BoxPlot.png|center|700px]]\n\nThis is why standardization, or sometimes called feature scaling (scale data to mean 0 and standard deviation 1) is a crucial pre-processing step in many data analysis procedures and machine learning algorithms, including PCA. This allows the analysis to pay attention to all features equally, so that no variable dominates the others (equal importance).\n== Strengths & Weaknesses ==\n'''Strengths'''\n* Reduce complexity of data\n* Allows for concise visualization of main patterns in data\n* Remove correlated features\n* Enhance performance of algorithms\n* Reduce overfitting\n'''Weaknesses'''\n* Principle components are created based on linear assumptions\n* The created principle components are hard to interpret\n* Information loss through reduction of dimensionality (oftentimes acceptable)\n== Key Publications ==\n* Wold, S., Esbensen, K., & Geladi, P.

Ordination techniques rely strongly on a profound knowledge of the underlying data format of the respective dataset that is being analysed. Since ordination allow for both inductive and deductive analysis, they often pose a risk for beginners, who typically get confused by the diversity of approaches and the answers these analysis may provide. This conduction is often increased by the model parameters available to evaluate the results, since much of ordination techniques allows for neither probability based assumptions, let alone more advanced information based techniques. What is more, ordinations are often deeply entangled in disciplinary cultures, with some approaches such as factor analysis being almost exclusive to some disciplines, and other approaches such as principal component analysis being utilised in quite diverse ways within different disciplines. This makes norms and rules when and how to apply different techniques widely scattered and intertwined with disciplinary norms, while the same disciplines are widely ignorant about other approach from different disciplines. Here, we try to diver a diverse and reflected overview of the different techniques, and what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. This will necessary demand a certain simplification, and will in addition trigger controversy within certain branches of science, and these controversies are either rooted in partial knowledge or in experiential  identity. Unboxing the whole landscape of ordinations is also a struggle because these analysis are neither discrete nor always conclusive. Instead they pose starting points that often serve initial analysis, or alternatively enable analysis widely uncoupled from the vast landscape of univariate statistics. We need to acknowledge to this end that there is a vast difference between the diverse approaches not only in the underlying mathematics, yet also how these may be partly ignored. This is probably the hardest struggle that you can fin neither in textbooks nor in articles. The empirical reality is that many applications of ordinations violate much of the mathematical assumptions or rules, yet the patterns derived from these analyses are still helpful if not even valid. Mathematicians can choose to live in a world where much of ordination techniques is perfect in every way, yet the datasets the world gives to ordinations are simply not. Instead, we have to acknowledge that multivariate data is almost always messy, contains a high amount of noise, many redundancies, and even data errors. Safety comes in numbers. Ordinations are so powerful exactly because they can channel all these problems through the safety of the size of the data, and thus derive either initial analysis or even results that serve as endpoints. However, there is a difference between initial or final results, and this will be our first starting point here."],"43":["If the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore. This does not mean that your results are biased, it only means that another approach can create a linear regression that more adequately models the actual trend in the data. In most cases, you can transform the data in a way that the OLS mechanics function again.\nTo find out if either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity is the case, we can look at the data with the help of different visualization approaches.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"sex\") ## creates a pairplot with a matrix of each variable on the y- and x-axis, but gender, which is colored in orange (hue= \"sex\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored of the final written exam, exercise and number of solved questions among males and females (gender group).\n\nLooking a the graphs along the diagonal line, it shows a higher peak among the male students than the female students for the written exam, solved question (quanti) and exercise points (points). Looking at the relationship between exam and points, no clear pattern can be identified. Therefore, it cannot be safely assumed, that a heteroscedastic dispersion is given.\n[[File:Pic 1.png|700px]]\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"group\", diag_kind=\"hist\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored in the final written exam, for the exercises and number of solved questions solved among the learning groups A,B and C.\n\n[[File:Pic 2.png|700px]]\n\nThe histograms among the diagonal line from top left to bottom right show no normal distribution. The histogram for id can be ignored since it does not provide any information about the student records. Looking at the relationship between exam and points, a slight pattern could be identified that would hint to heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\n===Correlations with Heatmap===\nA heatmap shows the correlation between different variables. Along the diagonal line from left to right, there is perfect positive correlation because it is the correlation of one variable against itself. Generally, you can assess the heatmap fully visually, since the darker the square, the stronger the correlation.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\np=sns.heatmap(data.corr(),\n              annot=True, cmap='PuBu');\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:Pic 3.png]]","Firstly, the aim for analyzing the dataset is to figure out the performance scored among the learning groups and gender for the solved questions, exercises and written exams.\n\nSecondly, we want to figure out the correlation between variables and most importantly to figure out heteroscedastic and homoscedastic dispersion, since the OLS is only apt when homoscedasticity is the case.\n\nTo analyse this data, some python libraries have to be imported:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport pandas as pd ## to organize data\nimport numpy as np ## to make mathematical computations\nimport statsmodels.api as sm ## needed for statistial anaysis\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf ## needed to write more complex statistical models\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## to make plots\nimport seaborn as sns ## for visualization\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols ## to use OLS\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing ## needed for regression analysis\nfrom statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan ## for checking your multiple regression model\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Data Inspection===\nData inspection is made to check if the data is clean for better graphical performance. The cleaning involves checking for missing values and the data format. The dataset is randomly generated based on a few cornerstone observations from an actual data science class.

If the median is closer to the lower (or left) end of the box, the data is considered to be right-skewed. If the median is closer to the upper (or right) end of the box, the data is considered to be left-skewed.\nThere are several ways to exactly measure the skewness of data, such as the Bowley-Galton skewness or Pearson's coefficient of skewness. Unfortunately, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, different skewness measures might give different or even contradictory results.\nA hands-on approach for R is included in the further readings below.\n\n* '''Compactness of data sections:'''\nIf one side of the box is larger than the other, it means that the values in this section are spread over a wider range. If it is smaller than the other one, the values in this section are more densely distributed.\n\n*'''Distance and number of outliers:'''\nThe number of outliers and their distance from the rest of the data can be easily read from the diagram.\n\n* '''Significance of difference between two datasets:'''\nIn case of a normal distribution, the significance of the difference between the data of two box plots can be roughly estimated: If the box of one box plot is higher or lower than the median of another box plot, the difference is likely to be significant. Further investigation is recommended.\n\n== Conclusion ==\nWe can conclude that both histogram and boxplots are a great tool in displaying how our values are distributed. As stated in [[Introduction to statistical figures]], boxplots compared to histogram show the variance of continuous data across different factor levels and are a solid graphical representation of the Analysis of Variance. One could see box plots less informative than a histogram or kernel density estimate but they take up less space and are better at comparing distributions between several groups or sets of data."],"44":["'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2). \n\nToday, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nScenario Planning is the systematic development of descriptions of (typically multiple) plausible futures, which are then called \"scenarios\". These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them \"(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all \"fundamentally different\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios \"(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).","[[File:ConceptVisualisationScenarioPlanning.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Scenario Planning]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n| [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Present|Present]] || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Scenario Planning is a systematic designation of potential futures to enable long term strategic planning.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Scenario planning.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Scenario Planning until 2019.'''

The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were \"(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]\" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).","They received feedback to these scenario drafts in a second round of workshops.

Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).\n\nMoreno's and Jennings' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of ''''group dynamics', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.''' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology.

His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued \"against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|'''Moreno's original work on Social Networks.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]","Social Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.894]]\n\nThe Social Network Analyst then analyzes these relations \"(...) for structural patterns that emerge among these actors. Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3).

For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nThis entry aims to introduce Stacked Area Plot and its visualization using R\u2019s <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot2<\/syntaxhighlight> package. A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.","* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R.

Thought Experiments can thus unleash a transformative potential within individuals, as people question the status quo in their norms and morals. Another strength of Thought Experiments is the possibility to consider different futures, as well as alternatives of the past. Thought Experiments are thus as versatile and flexible as people's actions or decision, and the ''What if'' of Thought Experiments allows us to re-design our world and make deep inquiries into alternative state of the world. This makes Thought Experiments potentially time-saving, and also resource-efficient. If we do not need to test our assumptions in the real world, our work may become more efficient, and we may even be able to test assumptions that would be unethical in the real world. '''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat experiment is purely theoretical, and thus not only important for physics, but also better for the cat.''' This latest strength is equally also the greatest weakness of Thought Experiments. We might consider all different option about alternative states of the world, yet we have to acknowledge that humankind has a long history of being wrong in terms of our assumptions about the world. In other words, while Thought Experiments are so fantastic because they can be unburdened by reality, this automatically means that they are also potentially different from reality. Another potential flaw of Thought Experiments is that they are only as good as our assumptions and reflections about the world. A four-year-old making up theThought Experiment \"What if I have an unlimited amount of ice cream?\" would consequently drown or freeze in the unlimited amount of ice cream. Four-year-olds are not aware of the danger of the \"unlimited\", and may not be the best Thought Experimenters. The same holds true for many other people, and just as our norms and values change, the value of specific Thought Experiments can change over time. Thought Experiments are like a reflection, and any reflection can be blurry, partly, bended, or plain wrong - the last case, if we cannot identify our reflection in the mirror of Thought Experiments.","[[File:Schr\u00f6dingers Cat.png|400px|thumb|left|'''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.''' Source: [https:\/\/ad4group.com\/schrodingers-cat-and-the-marketing-strategy\/ AD4Group].]]\n\nSo far, we see that there are Thought Experiments that resolve exclusively about a - subjective - human decision, and other types of Thought Experiments that are designed around setting in the physical world. The difference between these two is in the design of the experiment itself, as the first are always focused on the normative decisions or people, while the second focuses on our normative interpretation of anticipation of a design that is without a human influence. This distinction is already helpful, yet another dimension is about time. Many Thought Experiments are independent of time, while others try to reinterpret the past to make assumptions about a future about which we have no experience. Thought Experiments that focus on re-interpretation of the past (\"What if the assassination of Franz Ferdinands failed? Would the first World War still have happened?\") look for alternative pathways of history, often to understand the historical context and - more impotantly - the consequences of this context better. Most Thought Experiments are independent of a longer time scale. These experiments - such as the Trolley experiment - look at a very close future, and are often either very constructed or lack a connection to a specific context. Thought Experiments that focus on the future are often build around utopian or at least currently unthinkable examples that question the status quo, either form an ethical, societal, cultural or any other perspective. Such desirable futures are deeply normative yet can build an important bridge to our current reality through backcasting (\"What if there is no more poverty, and how can we achieve this?\"). \n\nAll this exemplifies that Thought Experiments are deeply normative, and show a great flexibility in terms of the methodological design setup in space and time. Some of the most famous Thought Experiments (such as the [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Teletransportation_paradox tele-transportation paradox]) are quite unconnected from our realities, yet still they are. This is the great freedom of Thought Experiments, as they help us to understand something basically about ourselves.

There are multiple approaches to detecting and dealing with outliers in time series data. We will have a look at detecting outliers first: 1. Distribution-based outlier detection: This detection method relies on the assumption that the data follows a certain known distribution. Then all points outside this distribution are considered outliers. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 2. Distance-based outlier detection: This method computes the distance from one point to all other points. A point is considered \u201cclose\u201d to another point when the distance between them is below a set threshold. Then, a point is considered an outlier if the fraction of points deemed close to that point is below a threshold. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 3. Local outlier factor (LOF): The local outlier factor (LOF) is a measure of how anomalous an object is within a dataset, based on the density of its local neighborhood. The LOF is computed by comparing the density of an object's neighborhood to the densities of the neighborhoods of its nearest neighbors. If the density of an object's neighborhood is significantly lower than the densities of its neighbors' neighborhoods, then it is considered an outlier (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n1. is best to use when you have an idea of the distribution of your data, ideally if the data is normally distributed. This is especially the case for very large datasets.\n\n2. Is best when you expect outliers spread across the distribution, but you don't know the distribution.\n\n3. Is best when you want to identify outliers in clusters or in varying densities because you compare the data points to their neighbors. To decide, you can assess the distribution visually. For a better overview of the different approaches to handling outliers in general, see [[Outlier_Detection_in_Python|here]].\nIn general, many outlier detection methods are available ready-to-use in numerous python packages. This is an example of using the local outlier factor from the package scikit-learn:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports the necessary packages for visualization.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor ## imports the function for the local outlier function","The autocorrelation largely ranges between -0.2 and 0.2 and is considered to be a weak autocorrelation and can be neglected.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports necessary functions to create a plot\nfrom statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf ## imports functions to calculate the confidence intervals (the so-called autocorrelation function)\n\nfig = plot_acf(df['usage_kwh'], alpha=.05, lags=24*4*2) ## creates a plot for the autocorrelation function of the electricity usage for two days (24*4 measurements per day (4 per hour) times 2)\nlabel_range = np.arange(0, len(steps), 24*2) ## sets the range for the  days of the label\nplt.xticks(ticks=label_range, labels=[x*15\/60 for x in label_range]) ## determines the number of ticks on x axis\nplt.xlabel('Lag (hours)') ## title x axis\nplt.ylabel('Autocorrelation of electricity usage with confidence interval') ## title y axis\nplt.title('') ## no plot title\nplt.ylim((-.25, 1.)) ## sets the limit of the y axis\nfig.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:ACF conf.png|700px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 6: Autocorrelation of electricity usage over two days<\/small>\n\nValues in the shaded region are statistically not significant, so there is a chance higher than 5% that there is no autocorrelation.","Forecasting time series data can be of tremendous value in information gain. Since this is a large topic, this article will only touch on one method for forecasting: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models, or ARIMA for short. It consists of three parts:\n\n* The autoregressive (AR) component, which models the autocorrelation of the time series\n* The integrated (I) component, which models the non-stationary bits of the time series\n* The moving average (MA) component, which models the noise or error in the time series.\n\nEach component requires an appropriate selection of parameters. Choosing the right parameters can yield a powerful model. However, finding good values of the parameters can be difficult and requires further complicated techniques.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport statsmodels.api as sm ## needed to employ ARIMA\n\n# Fit the model on all data except for the last day (last 96 measurements). Order refers to the order of the different processes. The three numbers refer to the order of autoregression, the order of integration, and the order of the moving average process, respectively. With this information, Python can correct these issues and therefore optimize the forecasting results. freq='15T' indicates that the data has been collected every 15 minutes. \nmodel = sm.tsa.ARIMA(df['usage_kwh'].iloc[:-96], order=(1, 0, 0), freq='15T')\nmodel_fit = model.fit() ## estimates the best model\n\n# Predict how the last day is going to be\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\nfull_df = pd.concat([\n    pd.DataFrame({'value': forecast, 'name': 'forecast'}),\n    pd.DataFrame({'value': df['usage_kwh'].iloc[-192:], 'name': 'existing'})## -192 to get the data for the last two days\n])\n\npx.line(full_df, y='value', color='name',\n        title='Last day of electricity usage with prediction of the next 24 hours',\n        labels={'index': 'Date', 'value': 'Usage (KWh)'}) ##produce plot\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:forecast plot.png|900px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 8: Forecast of the last day of the dataset compared to the actual values<\/small>\n\nARIMA models struggle with seasonality and often predict the mean of a highly seasonal time series a few steps ahead, just like in this example. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models take into account seasonality and are thus more suited for datasets that exhibit a strong seasonality (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018). This would then be the next step to use another model, but this more simple example should suffice to show how forecasting with time series data generally works."],"49":["To illustrate the choice of methods in transdisciplinary research, how the selected methods can be combined, and how they relate to agency, see one of the following examples.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Besatzfisch.png|450px|thumb|center|The research project \"Besatzfisch\". [http:\/\/besatz-fisch.de\/content\/view\/90\/86\/lang,german\/  Source]]]\n* The research project [http:\/\/besatz-fisch.de\/content\/view\/34\/57\/lang,german\/ \"Besatzfisch\"] is a good example of a long-term transdisciplinary research project that engages with different methodological approaches. This four year project attempted to '''understand the ecological, social and economic role and effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems.''' First, fish was introduced to ecosystems and the subsequent population dynamics were qualitatively & quantitatively measured, much of this jointly with the cooperating anglers (''Cooperation''). Second, anglers were questioned about fish population sizes and their economic implications (''Consultation'') before the data was analyzed using monetary modelling. Third, decision-making processes were modelled based on conversations with anglers, and their mental models about fishing were evaluated (''Consultation''). Fourth, participatory workshops were conducted to help anglers optimize their fishing grounds (''Empowerment''). Fifth, social-ecological models were developed based on the previous empirical results. (''Consultation'') Sixth, the project results are published in different forms of media for different target groups (''Information'').\n\n* Another interesting example is the article [https:\/\/www.ecologyandsociety.org\/vol23\/iss2\/art9\/ \"Combining participatory scenario planning and systems modeling to identify drivers of future sustainability on the Mongolian Plateau\"]. In order to '''assess potential future social-ecological developments in Mongolia''', researchers first held a workshop with stakeholders, mostly from academia but with diverse disciplinary backgrounds, and a few non-scientific stakeholders. In this workshop, first, key elements that influence sustainable development in the region were identified. Step by step, these were then ranked to identify critical uncertainties, which led to the development of potential future scenarios (''Consultation''). Also, the stakeholders' opinions on the workshop were later assessed through interviews, indicating positive impacts on their work and perspectives (''Empowerment''). The insights from the workshops were translated into system dynamics models by the researchers that were iteratively feedbacked by the stakeholders (''Consultation''), which led to a final model (''Information''). This approach was not purely transdisciplinary but illustrates a transdisciplinary workflow.","Die folgenden Beispiele zeigen auf, wie die ausgew\u00e4hlten Methoden kombiniert werden k\u00f6nnen und wie sie sich auf die Agency beziehen.\n\n== Beispiele ==\n[[File:Besatzfisch.png|450px|thumb|center|Das Forschungsprojekt \"Besatzfisch\".

Zun\u00e4chst wurden Fische in die \u00d6kosysteme eingef\u00fchrt und die nachfolgende Populationsdynamik qualitativ und quantitativ gemessen, vieles davon gemeinsam mit den kooperierenden Anglern (\"Kooperation\"). Zweitens wurden die Angler*innen \u00fcber die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Fischpopulationen und ihre wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen befragt (''Konsultation''), bevor die Daten mit Hilfe von monet\u00e4ren Modellen analysiert wurden.
