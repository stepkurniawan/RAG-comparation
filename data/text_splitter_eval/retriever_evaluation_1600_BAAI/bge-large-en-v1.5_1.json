First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and Roger Longbotham. \u201cOnline Controlled Experiments and A\/B Testing.\u201d Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, 2017, 922\u201329. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4899-7687-1_891Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nKoning, Rembrand, Sharique Hasan, and Aaron Chatterji. \u201cExperimentation and Start-up Performance: Evidence from A\/B Testing.\u201d Management Science 68, no. 9 (September 2022): 6434\u201353. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1287\/mnsc.2021.4209Add to Citavi project by DOI.\n\nSiroker, Dan, and Pete Koomen.

Edited by Milan Maushart"],"1":["In addition, the original ANOVA builds on balanced designs, which means that all categories are represented by an equal sample size. Extensions have been developed later on in this regard, with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.\n\nIn addition, the ANOVA is equally limited as the regression, as both build on the [[Data_distribution#The_normal_distribution|normal distribution]]. Extensions of the ANOVA translated its analytical approach into the logic of [[Generalized Linear Models|generalised linear models]], enabling the implementation of other distributions as well. What unites all different approaches is the demand that the ANOVA has in terms of data, and with increasing complexity, the demands increase when it comes to the sample sizes. Within experimental settings, this can be quite demanding, which is why the ANOVA only allows to test very constructed settings of the world. All categories that are implemented as predictors in an ANOVA design represent a constructed worldview, which can be very robust, but is always a compromise. The ANOVA thus tries to approximate causality by creating more rigid designs. However, we have to acknowledge that experimental designs are always compromises, and more knowledge may become available later. Within clinical trials - most of which have an ANOVA design at their heart - great care is taken into account in terms of robustness and documentation, and clinical trial stages are built on increasing sample sizes to minimise the harm on humans in these experiments.\n\n'''Taken together, the ANOVA is one of the most relevant calculation tools to fuel the exponential growth that characterised the 20th century.''' Agricultural experiments and medical trials are widely built on the ANOVA, yet we also increasingly recognise the limitations of this statistical model. Around the millennium, new models emerged, such as [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. But at its core, the ANOVA is the basis of modern deductive statistical analysis.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nDesigning an ANOVA-based design demands experience, and knowledge of the previous literature. The deductive approach of an ANOVA is thus typically embedded into an incremental development in the literature. ANOVA-based designs are therefore more often than not part of the continuous development in normal science. However, especially since the millennium, other more advanced approaches gained momentum, such as mixed effect models, information theoretical approaches, and structural equation models. The rigid root of the normal distribution and the basis of p-values is increasingly recognised as rigid if not outright flawed, and model reduction in more complex ANOVA designs is far from coherent between different branches of sciences. Some areas of science reject p-driven statistics altogether, while other branches of science are still publishing full models without any model reduction whatsoever. In addition, the ANOVA is today also often used to analyse inductive datasets, which is technically ok, but can infer several problems from a statistical standpoint, as well as based on a critical perspective rooted in a coherent theory of science. \n\nHence the ANOVA became a swiss army knive for group comparison for a continuous variable, and whenever different category levels need to be compared across a dependent variable, the ANOVA is being pursued. Whether there is an [[Causality|actual question of dependency]] is often ignored, let alone model assumptions and necessary preconditions. '''Science evolved, and with it, our questions became ever more complex, as are the problems that we face in the world, or that want to test.''' [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence#Complexity|Complexity]] reigns, and simple designs are more often than not questioned. The ANOVA remains as one of the two fundamental models of deductive statistics, with [[Regression Analysis|regression]] being the other important line of thinking. As soon as rigid questions of dependence were conveniently ignored, statisticians - or the researchers that applied statistics - basically dug the grave for these rigid yet robust approaches. There are still many cases where the ANOVA represents the most parsimonious and even adequate model. However, as long as positivist scientists share a room with a view in their ivory tower and fail to clearly indicate the limitations of their ANOVA-based designs, they undermine their [[Glossary|credibility]], and with it the [[Glossary|trust]] between science and society. The ANOVA is a testimony of how much statsicsi can serve society, for better or worse. The ANOVA may serve as a sound approximations of knowledge, yet at its worst it speaks of the arrogance of researchers who imply [[Causality|causality]] into mere patterns that can and will change once more knowledge becomes available.\n\n== Outlook ==\nThe Analysis of Variance was one of the most relevant contributions of statistics to the developments of the 20th century. By allowing for the systematic testing of hypotheses, not only did a whole line of thinking of the theory of science evolve, but whole disciplines were literally emerging. Lately, frequentist statistics was increasingly critizised for its reliance on p-values. Also, the reproducibility crisis highlights the limitations of ANOVA-based designs, which are often not reproducible. Psychological research faces this challenge for instance by pre-registering studies, indicating their statistical approach before approaching the data, and other branches of science are also attempting to do more justice to the limitations of the knowledge of experiments. In addition, new ways of experimentation of science evolve, introducing a systematic approach to case studies and solution oriented approaches. This may open a more systematic approach to inductive experiments, making documentation a key process in the creation of a canonised knowledge. Scientific experiments were at the forefront of developments that are seen more critically regarding their limitations. Taking more complexities into account, ANOVAs become a basis for more advanced statistics, and they can indeed serve as a robust basis if the limitations are clearly indicated, and the ANOVA designs add to parts of a larger picture of knowledge. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n'''Theoretical'''\n\nCrawley, M.

This means that any past information one has can be used in a fruitful way.\n* Bayesian approach provides a more intuitive and direct statement of the probability that the hypothesis is true, as opposed to the frequentist approach where the interpretation of p-value is convoluted.\n\n* Even though the concept is intuitive to understand, the mathematical formulation and definitions can be intimidating for beginners.\n* Identifying correct prior distribution can be very difficult in real life problems which are not based on careful experimental design.\n* Solving complex models with Bayesian approach is still computationally expensive.\n\n\n== Normativity ==\nIn contrast to a Frequentist approach, the Bayesian approach allows researchers to think about events in experiments as dynamic phenomena whose probability figures can change and that change can be accounted for with new data that one receives continuously. Just like the examples presented above, this has several flipsides of the same coin.\n\nOn the one hand, Bayesian Inference can overall be understood as a deeply [[:Category:Inductive|inductive]] approach since any given dataset is only seen as a representation of the data it consists of. This has the clear benefit that a model based on a Bayesian approach is way more adaptable to changes in the dataset, even if it is small. In addition, the model can be subsequently updated if the dataset is growing over time. '''This makes modeling under dynamic and emerging conditions a truly superior approach if pursued through Bayes' theorem.''' In other words, Bayesian statistics are better able to cope with changing condition in a continuous stream of data. \n\nThis does however also represent a flip side of the Bayesian approach. After all, many data sets follow a specific statistical [[Data distribution|distribution]], and this allows us to derive clear reasoning on why these data sets follow these distributions. Statistical distributions are often a key component of [[:Category:Deductive|deductive]] reasoning in the analysis and interpretation of statistical results, something that is theoretically possible under Bayes' assumptions, but the scientific community is certainly not very familiar with this line of thinking. This leads to yet another problem of Bayesian statistics: they became a growing hype over the last decades, and many people are enthusiastic to use them, but hardly anyone knows exactly why. Our culture is widely rigged towards a frequentist line of thinking, and this seems to be easier to grasp for many people. In addition, Bayesian approaches are way less implemented software-wise, and also more intense concerning hardware demands. \n\nThere is no doubt that Bayesian statistics surpass frequentists statistics in many aspects, yet in the long run, Bayesian statistics may be preferable for some situations and datasets, while frequentists statistics are preferable under other circumstances. Especially for predictive modeling and small data problems, Bayesian approaches should be preferred, as well as for tough cases that defy the standard array of statistical distributions. Let us hope for a future where we surely know how to toss a coin. For more on this, please refer to the entry on [[Non-equilibrium dynamics]].\n\n== Outlook ==\nBayesian methods have been central in a variety of domains where outcomes are probabilistic in nature; fields such as engineering, medicine, finance, etc. heavily rely on Bayesian methods to make forecasts. Given that the computational resources have continued to get more capable and that the field of machine learning, many methods of which also rely on Bayesian methods, is getting more research interest, one can predict that Bayesian methods will continue to be relevant in the future. \n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Bayes, T. 1997.

Many negative effects of chemicals were not anticipated, with prominent examples being FCKW, pesticides and antibiotics. The effect of different medical drugs on people is yet another example, since interactions between different medications are hardly understood at all, as the field only slowly unravels the negative side-effects of interacting medications or treatments. We are far away from understanding the impact that the concepts ''agency'', ''complex systems'' and ''emergence'' have on our knowledge. Yet, we need to diversify our canon of methods in order to approach these concepts from an empirical standpoint. Otherwise we will not be able to unlock new strata of knowledge. This includes the combination of different methods, the utilization of specific methods in a different context, as well as the development of novel methods.\n\nWhat is however clear is that the three concepts - agency, complexity and emergence - have consequences about our premises of empirical knowledge. What if ultimately nothing is generalisable? What if all valid arguments are only valid for a certain time? And what if some strata will forever escape a truly reliable measurement? We [[Big problems for later|cannot answer]] these problems here, yet it is important to differentiate what we know, what we may be able to know, and what we will probably never know. The [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/uncertainty-principle uncertainty principle of Heisenberg] in Quantum mechanics which refers to the the position and momentum of particles illustrates that some things cannot be approximated, observed or known. Equal claims can be made about larger phenomena, such as personal identity. Hence, as much as agency, complex systems and emergence can be boundary objects for methods, they equally highlight our (current) limitations.\n\n\n== The way forward ==\nIf we want to empirically investigate agency, we first and foremost investigate individuals, or actions of entities we consider as non-variable, or consequences of actions of individuals. All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.''' Because of this, much of our current knowledge of agency is either rooted in widely deductive experimental settings or the testing of very clear hypotheses, or questions of either logic or metaphysics, which are widely associated with philosophy. \n\nThe investigation of complex system has thrived in the last decades, both from an empirical as well as from a conceptual perspective. Many methods emerged or were subsequently adapted to answer questions as well as explore relations, and this thrive towards a deeper understanding of systems is at least one important difference to agency from a methodological standpoint. Much novel data is available, and often inductively explored. The scale of complex systems makes an intervention with a focus on [[Causality and correlation|causality]] a challenge, hence many investigated relations are purely correlative. Take for instance social media, or economic flows, which can be correlatively investigated, yet causality is an altogether different matter. This creates a methodological challenge, since many of our questions regarding human systems are normative, which is why many researchers assume causality in their investigations, or at least discuss relations as if these are causal. Another methodological problem related to causality are non-linear relations, since much of the statistical canon is based on probability and linear relations. While linear relations allow for a better inference of causal explanations, the long existing yet until recently hardly explored [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistics are an example that we can inductively learn about systems at a growing pace without being dependent on linearity or normal-distributions. This Bayesian revolution is currently under way, but much of the disciplines relying on statistics did not catch up on this yet. Other methodological approaches will certainly be explored to gain insight into the nuts and bolts of complex systems, yet this is only slowly emerging. \n\nThe whole globe - although not a closed system \u2013 can be seen as a global system, and this is certainly worthwhile pursuing from a methodological standpoint. Still, global dynamics consist of such diverse data, that simply the translational act to bring different data together seems almost impossible right now. While emergence can lead to novel solutions, globalisation and technology have triggered uncountable events of emergence, such as global conflicts, climate change, increase in cancer rates and biodiversity loss. Humankind did certainly not plan these potential endpoints of ourselves, instead they emerged out of unpredictable combinations of our actions, and the data that can represent them. From a methodological standpoint, these events are just as unpredictable as is the effect which two molecules have onto each other and the environment. '''Emergence is a truly cross-scalar phenomenon.''' Consequently, many methodological accounts to countermeasure threats to human societies are correlative if they are empirical. We are far away from any deep understanding of emergence, and what makes phenomena emergent.\n[[File:Climate model.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Climate models are increasingly getting more accurate, but the complexity and emergence of the global climate system may never be fully understood.'''

These three different qualities of knowledge clearly highlight that research will have to collaborate - agency, many complex systems and several phenomena that are emergent cannot be sufficiently investigated by one discipline alone. While chemistry may find emergence in chemical reactions, and medicine may find interactions between different drugs, these results become normative as soon as they are applicable in the real world. To this claim, one could make the exception of ethics or broadly speaking philosophy here, which can meaningfully engage with all three domains of knowledge - unobserved, not known and never known - yet may not be able to contribute to all empirical problems. On the other end, everything but philosophy may only be able to go into the un-observed and unknown. We need to combine our methodological approaches to create the knowledge that is needed now. The need for collaboration is a question of responsibility, and only if all disciplines dissolve (or at least redefine their main goal to unite and not differentiate), agency may be fully explored and complex problems may be solved. Many of the solutions we have in our hands right now already would seem like wizardry to our ancestors. It is our responsibility to continue on this path, not as technocrats or positivists that have arrogant pride of their achievement, but as mere contributors to a wider debate that should ultimately encompass all society. \n\nTo say it with Derek Parfit:\n\n\"Some things (...) matter, and there are better and worse way to live. After many thousands of years of responding to reasons in ways that helped them to survive and reproduce, human beings can now respond to other reasons. We are a part of a Universe that is starting to understand itself. And we can partly understand, not only what is in fact true, but also what ought to be true, and what we might be able to make true. What now matters the most is that we avoid ending human history. If there are no rational beings elsewhere, it may depend on us and our successors whether it will all be worth it, because the existence of the Universe will have been on the whole good.\""],"4":["'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==Missing values: types and distributions==\n\nMissing values are a common problem in many datasets. They can occur for a variety of reasons, such as data not being collected or recorded accurately, data being excluded because it was deemed irrelevant, or respondents being unable or unwilling to provide answers to certain questions (Tsikriktsis 2005, 54-55).\n\nIn this text, we will explore the different types of missing values and their distributions and discuss the implications for data analysis.\n\n==Types of missing values==\n\nThere are two main types of missing values: unit nonresponse and item nonresponse missing values. Item nonresponse occurs when an individual respondent is unable to provide an answer to a specific question on a survey or questionnaire (Schafer and Graham 2002, 149).\n\nUnit nonresponse occurs when an entire unit, such as a household or business, is unable to provide answers to a survey or questionnaire (ibid.).\n\nNext, we will look at how missing values can be distributed and what the implications of such distributions are. Generally, both types of missing values can occur in any distribution.\n\n==Distributions of missing values==\n\nThe distribution of missing values in a dataset can be either random or non-random. This can have a significant impact on the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data. Three common distributions of missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR) (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\n===Missing completely at random===\nMissing completely at random (MCAR) is a type of missing data where the missing values are not related to any other variables in the dataset, and they do not follow any particular pattern or trend. In other words, the missing values are completely random and do not contain any necessary information (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\nThe implications of MCAR for data analysis are relatively straightforward. Because the missing values are completely random, they do not introduce any bias into the analysis. Therefore, it is generally safe to impute the missing values using statistical methods, such as mean imputation or multiple imputations. However, even if the missing values are MCAR, there may still be other factors that can affect the analysis. It is important to consider the number and proportion of missing values (Scheffer 2002, 156). The larger the proportion of missing values in your overall dataset the less reliable is the use of the data. Imagine you had many unit nonresponse missing values across many different individuals, which results in having no variable without any missing value. This might affect the quality of your dataset. If and how this is the case, needs to be decided case by case.\n\n===Missing at random===\nMissing at random (MAR) is a type of missing data where the missing values are not related to the missing values themselves, but they might be to other variables in the dataset. In other words, the missing values are not completely random, but they are not systematically related to the true value of the missing values either (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55). For example, imagine you conduct a survey to analyze the relationship between education and income and there are missing values concerning income. If the missing values depend on education, then these missing values are missing at random. If they would depend on their actual income, they would not.\n\nThe implications of MAR for data analysis are more complex than those for MCAR. Because the missing values are not completely random, they may introduce bias into the analysis if they are not properly accounted for. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the underlying reasons for the missing data and take these into account when imputing the missing values. One common approach to dealing with MAR missing values is to use regression or other statistical methods to model the relationship between the missing values and the other variables in the dataset (Tsikriktsis 2005, 56). Once the relationship is clear, other methods can be used to approximate to correct the variables for the bias due to the missing values missing at random.\n\n===Missing not at random===\nMissing not at random (MNAR) is a type of missing data that is related to both the observed and unobserved data. This means that the missing data are not random and are instead influenced by some underlying factor. This can lead to biased results if the missing data are not properly accounted for in the analysis (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\nThe implications of MNAR for data analysis are more complex than those for MCAR or MAR. Because the missing values are systematically related to the true values of the missing data, they can introduce bias into the analysis if they are not properly accounted for. In some cases, this bias may be difficult or impossible to correct, even with advanced statistical methods (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55).\n\n==Determining the randomness of missing data==\n\nThere are two common methods to determine the randomness of missing data. The first method involves forming two groups: one with missing data for a single variable and one with valid values for that variable. If significant differences are found between the two groups regarding their relationship to other variables of interest, it may indicate a non-random missing data process. The second method involves assessing the correlation of missing data for any pair of variables. If low correlations are found between pairs of variables, it may indicate complete randomness in the missing data (MCAR). However, if significant correlations are found between some pairs of variables, it may be necessary to assume that the data are only missing at random (MAR) (Tsikriktsis 2005, 55 - 56).\n\nOverall, the treatment of missing values should be tailored to the specific distribution of missing values in the dataset. It is important to carefully consider the underlying reasons for the missing data and take appropriate steps to address them in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.\n\n==References==\n\nSchafer, Joseph L., and John W.

Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page."],"6":["[[File:ConceptClusteringMethods.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Cohort Study]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || [[:Category:Future|Future]]\n|}\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n<br\/>\n'''In short:''' Clustering is a method of data analysis through the grouping of unlabeled data based on certain metrics.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Clustering SCOPUS.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits for Clustering until 2019.''' Search terms: 'Clustering', 'Cluster Analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nCluster analysis shares history in various fields such as anthropology, psychology, biology, medicine, business, computer science, and social science. \n\nIt originated in anthropology when Driver and Kroeber published Quantitative Expression of Cultural Relationships in 1932 where they sought to clusters of [[Glossary|culture]] based on different culture elements. Then, the method was introduced to psychology in the late 1930s.\n\n== What the method does ==\nClustering is a method of grouping unlabeled data based on a certain metric, often referred to as ''similarity measure'' or ''distance measure'', such that the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, and any points that lie in separate cluster are dissimilar. Clustering is a statistical method that falls under a class of [[Machine Learning]] algorithms named \"unsupervised learning\", although clustering is also performed in many other fields such as data compression, pattern recognition, etc. Finally, the term \"clustering\" does not refer to a specific algorithm, but rather a family of algorithms; the similarity measure employed to perform clustering depends on specific clustering model.\n\nWhile there are many clustering methods, two common approaches are discussed in this article.\n\n== Data Simulation ==\nThis article deals with simulated data. This section contains the function used to simulate the data. For the purpose of this article, the data has three clusters. You need to load the function on your R environment in order to simulate the data and perform clustering.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ncreate_cluster_data <- function(n=150, sd=1.5, k=3, random_state=5){\n    # currently, the function only produces 2-d data\n    \n    # n = no. of observation\n    # sd = within-cluster sd\n    # k = number of clusters\n    # random_state = seed\n    \n    set.seed(random_state)\n    dims = 2 # dimensions\n    xs = matrix(rnorm(n*dims, 10, sd=sd), n, dims)\n    clusters = sample(1:k, n, replace=TRUE)\n    centroids = matrix(rnorm(k*dims, mean=1, sd=10), k, dims)\n    clustered_x = cbind(xs + 0.5*centroids[clusters], clusters)\n    \n    plot(clustered_x, col=clustered_x[,3], pch=19)\n    \n    df = as.data.frame(x=clustered_x)\n    colnames(df) <- c(\"x1\", \"x2\", \"cluster\")\n    return(df)\n}\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== k-Means Clustering ===\n\nThe k-means clustering method assigns '''n''' examples to one of '''k''' clusters, where '''n''' is the sample size and  '''k''', which needs to be chosen before the algorithm is implemented, is the number of clusters. This clustering method falls under a clustering model called centroid model where centroid of a cluster is defined as the mean of all the points in the cluster. K-means Clustering algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimize the within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion based on the following formula:\n\n[[File:K-Means Sum of Squares Criterion.png|center]]\n\nThe in-cluster sum-of-squares is also called inertia in some literature.\n\nThe algorithm involves following steps:\n\n# The number of cluster '''k''' is chosen by the data analyst\n# The algorithm randomly picks '''k''' centroids and assigns each point to the closest centroid to get '''k''' initial clusters\n# The algorithm recalculates the centroid by taking average of all points in each cluster and updates the centroids and re-assigns the points to the closest centroid.\n# The algorithm repeats Step 3 until all points stop changing clusters.\n\nTo get an intuitive sense of how this k-means clustering algorithm works, visit: [https:\/\/www.naftaliharris.com\/blog\/visualizing-k-means-clustering\/ Visualizing K-Means Clustering]\n\n==== Implementing k-Means Clustering in R ====\n\nTo implement k-Means Clustering, the data table needs to only contain numeric data type. With a data frame or matrix with numeric value where the rows signify individual data example and the columns signify the ''features'' (number of features = the number of dimensions of the data set), k-Means clustering can be performed with the code below:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n# Generate data and perform the clustering\ndf <- create_cluster_data(150, 1.25, 3)\ndata_cluster = kmeans(df, centers=3) # perform the clustering\n\n# plot for sd = 1.25\nplot(df$x1, df$x2, \n     pch=df$cluster, \n     col=data_cluster$cluster, cex=1.3, \n     xlab=\"x1\", ylab=\"x2\", \n     main=\"k-Means Clustering Example with Clearly Clustered Data\", \n     sub=\"(In-cluster variance when generating data = 1.25)\")\npoints(data_cluster$centers[1,1], data_cluster$centers[1,2], \n       pch=15, cex=2, col=\"black\")\npoints(data_cluster$centers[2,1], data_cluster$centers[2,2], \n       pch=15, cex=2, col=\"red\")\npoints(data_cluster$centers[3,1], data_cluster$centers[3,2], \n       pch=15, cex=2, col=\"green\")\nlegend(\"topleft\", legend=c(\"True Cluster 1\", \"True Cluster 2\", \"True Cluster 3\", \"Cluster Center\"), \n       col=c(\"black\",\"black\",\"black\", \"black\"), pch = c(1, 2, 3, 15), cex=0.8)\ntext(-3.15, 10, \n     \"Colors signify the clusters identified\\nby k-means clustering algorithm\", \n     adj = c(0,0), cex=0.8)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere is the result of the preceding code:"],"7":["==== Step by Step ====\n* '''Type of Network:''' First, Social Network Analysts decide whether they intend to focus on a holistic view on the network (''whole networks''), or focus on the network surrounding a specific node of interest (''ego networks''). They also decide for either ''one-mode networks'', focusing on one type of node that could be connected with any other; or ''two-mode networks'' where there are two types of nodes, with each node unable to be connected with another node of the same type (Marin & Wellman 2010, 13). For a two-mode network, you could imagine an analysis of social events and the individuals that visit these, where each event is not connected to another event, but only to other individuals; and vice-versa.\n* '''Network boundaries:''' In a next step, the approach to defining nodes needs to be chosen. Three ways of defining networks can be named according to Marin & Wellman (2010, p.2, referring to Laumann et al. (1983)). These three are approaches not mutually exclusive and may be combined:\n** ''position-based approach'': considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally-defined positions to be network members, and all others would be excluded\n** ''event-based'' approach: those who had participated in key events are believed to define the population\n** ''relation-based approach'': begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.\n** Butts (2008) adds the ''exogenously defined boundaries'', which are pre-determined based on the research intent or theory which provide clearly specified entities of interest.\n* '''Type of ties:''' Then, the researcher needs to decide on which kinds of ties to focus. There can be two forms of ties between network nodes: ''directed'' ties, which go from one node to another, and ''undirected ties'', that connect two nodes without any distinct direction. Both types can either be [[Data formats|binary]] (they exist, or do not exist), or valued (they can be stronger or weaker than other ties): As an example, \"(..) a friendship network can be represented using binary ties that indicate if two people are friends, or using valued ties that assign higher or lower scores based on how close people feel to one another, or how often they interact.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14; Borgatti et al. 2009)\n* '''Data Collection''': When the research focus is chosen, the data necessary for Social Network Analysis can be gathered in [[Survey Research|Surveys]] or [[Interviews]], through [[Ethnography|Observation]], [[Content Analysis]] (typically literature-based) or similar forms of data gathering. Surveys and Interviews are most common, with the researchers asking individuals about the existence and strength of connections between themselves and others actors, or within other actors excluding themselves (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.14). There are two common approaches when surveying individuals about their own connections to others: In a ''prompted recall'' approach, they are asked which people they would think of with regards to a specific topic (e.g. \"To whom would you go for advice at work?\") while they are shown a pre-determined list of potentially relevant individuals. In the ''free list'' approach, they are asked to recall individuals without seeing a list (Butts 2008, p.20f).\n* '''Data Analysis''': When it comes to analyzing the gathered data, there are different network properties that researchers are interested in in accordance with their research questions. The analysis may be qualitative as well as quantitative, focusing either on the structure and quality of connections or on their quantity and values. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.16; Butts 2008, p.21f). The analysis can focus on \n** the quantity and quality of ties that connect to individual nodes\n** the similarity between different nodes, or\n** the structure of the network as a whole in terms of density, average connection length and strength or network composition.\n* An important element of the analysis is not just the creation of quantitative or qualitative insights, but also the '''visual representation''' of the network. For this, the researcher \"(...) will naturally seek the clearest visual arrangement, and all that matters is the pattern of connections.\" (Scott 1988, p.113) Based on the structure of the ties, the network can take different forms, such as the Wheel, Y, Chain or Circle shape.\nImportantly, the actual distance between nodes is thus not equatable with the physical distance in a [[Glossary|visualisation]]. Sometimes, nodes that are visually very close to each other are actually very far away. The actual distance between elements of the network should be measured based on the \"number of lines which it is necessary to traverse in order to get from one point to another.\" (Scott 1988, p.114)\n[[File:Social Network Analysis - Network Types.png|400px|thumb|right|'''Different network structures.'''

The dyads BE and BF - i.e. the connections between B and E, and B and F, respectively - are equally long in this network although BF appears to be shorter. This is due to the visual representation of the network, where B and F are closer to each other. Additionally, the central role of A becomes clear. Source: Scott 1988, p.114]]\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* There is a range of challenges in the gathering of network data through [[Semi-structured Interview|Interviews]] and [[Survey|Surveys]], which can become long and cumbersome, and in which the interviewees may differently understand and recall their relations with other actors, or misinterpret the connections between other actors. (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.15)\n* The definition of network boundaries is crucial, since \"(...) the inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of a small number of entities can have ramifications which extend well beyond those entities themselves\". Apart from the excluded entities and their relations, all relations between these entities and the rest of the network, and thus the network's structural properties, are affected. (Butts 2008).

This is done in order to see the true effect of the variable of interest on a dependent variable. Fundamental idea of ANCOVA is based on hypothesis testing, its goal is to evaluate multiple mutually exclusive theories about our [[Glossary|data]], where null hypothesis claims that the means of the groups are equal, and alternative [[Glossary|hypothesis]] rejects that based on p-value. Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.\n\n== Assumptions ==\n'''Regression assumptions'''  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.\n'''ANOVA assumptions'''\n# Variances between groups are homogeneous.\n# Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.\n'''Specific ANCOVA assumptions'''\n# A further specific (but optional) assumption is homogeneity of slopes. It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate. Since ANCOVA is hypothesis-based test, we need to have a understanding and well developed question about our data that we want an answer to, before we can generate a hypothesis and run the test.\n\n\n===Data preparation===\nIn order to demonstrate One-way ANCOVA test we will refer to balanced dataset \"anxiety\" taken from the \"datarium\" package. The data provides the anxiety score, measured at three time points, of three groups of individuals practicing physical exercises at different levels (grp1: basal, grp2: moderate and grp3: high).

This can be assessed as follow:"],"11":["== Strengths & Challenges ==\n* Narratives have their own inherent structure, formed by the narrating individual. Therefore, while narrative inquiry itself provides the benefits and challenges of a very open, reflexive and iterative research format, it is not non-structured, but gains structure by itself (see Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000)\n* Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) highlight that research methods that understand narratives as a mere format of data presented by the subject, which can then be analyzed just like other forms of content, neglect an important feature of narratives: Narrative Research \"(...) requires going beyond the use of narrative as rhetorical structure, to an analytic examination of the underlying insights and assumptions that the story illustrates\". Further, \"Narrative inquiry attempts to capture the 'whole story', whereas other methods tend to communicate understandings of studied subjects or phenomena at certain points, but frequently omit the important 'intervening' stages\" (ibid, p.3), with the latter being the context and cultural surrounding that is better understood when taking the whole narrative into account (see Moen 2006, p.59).\n* '''The insights gained through narratives are subjective to the narrator, which implies advantages and challenges.''' Compared to an 'objective' description of, e.g. a chain of events, the narration provides insights about the individual's interpretation and experience of the events, which may be inaccessible elsewhere, and shine light on complex social phenomena: \"Narrative is not an objective reconstruction of life - it is a rendition of how life is perceived.\" (Webster & Mertova 2007, p.3; see Moen 2006, p.62). However, this subjective representation of events or a situation may be distorted and differ from the 'real' world. Squire et al. (2014) refer to this distinction as different forms of 'truth' that researchers may be interested in: either representations of the physical world or of social realities which present the world through the lense of the narrator. Jovchelovitch & Bauer (2000, p.6) suggest that the researchers take both elements into consideration, first fully engaging with the subjective narrative, then comparing it to further information on the physical 'truth'. They should try \"(...) to render the narrative with utmost fidelity (in the first moment) and to organize additional information from different sources, to collate secondary material and to review literature or documentation about the event being investigated. Before we enter the field we need to be equipped with adequate materials to allow us to understand and make sense of the stories we gather.\" Moen (2006, p.63), by comparison, explains that \"(...) there is no static and everlasting truth\", anyway.\n* This [[Bias and Critical Thinking|conflict between different 'truths']] also has consequences for the quality criteria for Narrative Inquiry, especially for those research endeavors that create narratives themselves. To this end, 'usefulness' and 'persuasiveness' of the created narratives have been suggested as quality criteria (Barrett & Stauffer 2009) or, as Webster & Mertova (2007, p.4) put it: \"Narrative research (...) does not strive to produce any conclusions of certainty, but aims for its findings to be 'well grounded' and 'supportable' (...) Narrative research does not claim to represent the exact 'truth', but rather aims for 'verisimilitude'\". (For more thoughts on validity in Narrative Inquiry, see Polkinghorne (2007)). For the analysis of narratives, a 'trustworthy' set of field notes and Interview data may serve as a measure of quality, which the researchers created through prolonged engagement in the field, triangulation of different data sources and the active search for disconfirmation of one's research results (see Moen 2006, p.64). Also, researchers \"(...) need to cogently argue that theirs is a viable interpretation grounded in the assembled texts\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.484).\n* Further challenges may arise during the active collaboration of the researcher in the field. For example, \"(...) the researcher and the research subjects interpret specific events in different ways or (...) the research subjects question the interpretive authority of the researcher\" (Moen 2006, p.62). Further comparable issues of qualitative field research are noted in the entry on [[Ethnography]].\n\n\n== Normativity ==\n* As mentioned before, Narrative Inquiry methodology is in many regards similar to methods in [[Ethnography]], and shares elements with [[Hermeneutics]], [[Content Analysis|Qualitative Content Analysis]], and [[Open Interview|Open Interviews.]] Generally, it can be seen as a purely qualitative and inductive approach that focuses on limited temporal and spatial scales.\n* \"(...) [A] distinguishing feature of Narrative Research is a \"(...) move away from an objective conception of the researcher-researched relationship\" (...) to one in which the researcher is deeply involved in the research relationship. (...) In this process, narrative inquiry, becomes to varying degrees a study of self, or self alongside others, as well as of the inquiry participants and their experience of the world.\" (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.11f, quote from Pinnegar & Daynes 2007, p.11). '''The autobiography of the researcher, as well as personal beliefs and practices and ethical positionality is brought into the research endeavor, which should be acknowledged in the process and results.''' \"Narrative inquirers cannot bracket themselves out of the inquiry but rather need to find ways to inquire into participants\u2019 experiences, their own experiences as well as the co-constructed experiences developed through the relational inquiry process.\" (Clandinin 2006, p.47)\n* Within this interaction in the field, the researcher must be aware of the consequences of creating new narratives in the studied subjects and situations, which is why Clandinin (2006, p.53) mentions \"(...) the importance of thinking in responsive and responsible ways about how narrative inquiry can shift the experiences of those with whom we engage\". In addition, Moen (2006, p.62) mentions that the narratives written down as a result of the research inquiry are themselves subject to interpretation: \"The story has been liberated from its origin and can enter into new interpretive frames, where it might assume meanings not intended by the persons involved in the original event. (...) [T]he narrative that is fixed in a text is thus considered an \u201copen work\u201d where the meaning is addressed to those who read and hear about it. Looking on narrative as an open text makes it possible to engage in a wide range of interpretations\".\n\n== Outlook ==\nBarrett & Stauffer (2009, p.16) claim that \"[n]arrative inquiry is still in its early stages of development (...). It will be subject to contestation over the years as the methodology develops, and other pathways are marked out.\" This can be substantiated by the dispersed literature with its diverse understandings (see References), and the rather recent development of the discourse around narratives.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\nVeroff et al. 1993.

They provide the possibility\nto measure the relation between any kind of quantitative data - may it be continuous, discrete and interval data, yet there are even correlations for ordinal data, although these shall be less relevant for us. In this entry you will learn about how to build correlation plots in R. To learn more about correlations in theoretical terms, please refer to the entry on [[Correlations]].

And always have in mind, '''correlations can tell you whether two variables are related, but cannot tell you anything about the causality between the variables!'''\n\nWith a bit experience, you can recognize quite fast, if there is a relationship between the variables. It is also possible to see, if the relationship is weak or strong and if there is a positive, negative or sometimes even no relationship. You can visualize correlation in many different ways, here we will have a look at the following visualizations:\n\n* Scatter Plot\n* Scatter Plot Matrix\n* Line chart\n* Correlogram\n\n\n'''A note on calculating the correlation coefficient:'''\nGenerally, there are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's rank coefficient. \n'''Pearson's correlation coefficient''' is the most popular among them. This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables. They show every observation as a dot in the graph and the further the dots scatter, the less they explain. The position of the dot on the x- and y-axis represent the values of the two numeric variables.\n[[File:MilesHorsePower2.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n\n=== R Code ===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n#Plotting the scatter plot\nplot(x = mtcars$mpg,\n     y = mtcars$hp,\n     main = \"Correlation between Miles per Gallon and Horsepower\",\n     xlab = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n     ylab = \"Horsepower\",\n     pch = 16,\n     col = \"red\",\n     las = 1,\n     xlim = c(min(mtcars$mpg), max(mtcars$mpg)),\n     ylim = c(min(mtcars$hp), max(mtcars$hp)))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn this scatter plot you can easily recognize a strong negative relationship between the variables \u201cmpg\u201d and \u201chp\u201d from the \u201cmtcars\u201d dataset.

In this example, the following parameters were defined:\n\n* '''x:''' variable, that will be displayed on the x-axis.\n* '''y:''' variable, that will be displayed on the y-axis.\n* '''xlab:''' title for the x-axis.\n* '''ylab:''' title for the y-axis.\n* '''pch:''' shape and size of the plotted observations, in this case, filled circles. [http:\/\/www.sthda.com\/english\/wiki\/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r Here] you can find an overview of the different possibilities.\n* '''col:''' plotting color. You can either write the name of the color or use the [https:\/\/www.r-graph-gallery.com\/41-value-of-the-col-function.html color number].\n* '''las:''' style of axis labels. By default it is always parallel to the axis. 1 is always horizontal, 2 is always perpendicular and 3 is always vertical to the axis.\n* '''xlim:''' set the limit of the x-axis.\n* '''ylim:''' set the limit of the y-axis.\n* '''abline:''' this function creates a regression line for the two variables.\n\n== Scatter Plot Matrix ==\n=== Definition ===\nThe normal scatter plot is only useful if you want to know the relationship between two variables, but often you are interested in more than two variables. A convenient way to visualize multiple variables in a scatter plot matrix is offered by the PerformanceAnalytics package. To access the scatter plot matrix from this package, you have to install the package and import the library. After doing that, you can start to select the variables which will be displayed in the plot.\n\n=== R Code ===\n[[File:Scatterplotmatrix.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.2]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.2\nlibrary(PerformanceAnalytics)\n\n# Now calling the chart.Correlation() function and defining a few parameters.\ndata <- mtcars[, c(1,3,4,6,7)]\nchart.Correlation(data, histogram = TRUE)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n\nThe scatter plot matrix from this package is already very nice by default. It splits the plot into an upper, lower and diagonal part. The upper part consists of the correlation coefficients for the different variables. The red stars show you the results of the implemented correlation test. There is a range from zero to three stars and the higher the number of stars, the higher is the significance of the results for the test. In the diagonal part of the plot are histograms for every variable and show you the distribution of the variable. The bivariate scatter plots can be found on the lower part of the plot and contain a fitted line by default.\n\n\n== Line chart ==\n=== Definition ===\nA line chart can help show how quantitative values for different categories have changed over time. They are typically structured around a temporal x-axis with equal intervals from the earliest to latest point in time. Quantitative values are plotted using joined-up lines that effectively connect consecutive points positioned along a y-axis. The resulting slopes formed between the two ends of each line provide an indication of the local trends between points in time.

They provide the possibility\nto measure the relation between any kind of quantitative data - may it be continuous, discrete and interval data, yet there are even correlations for ordinal data, although these shall be less relevant for us. In this entry you will learn about how to build correlation plots in R. To learn more about correlations in theoretical terms, please refer to the entry on [[Correlations]].

And always have in mind, '''correlations can tell you whether two variables are related, but cannot tell you anything about the causality between the variables!'''\n\nWith a bit experience, you can recognize quite fast, if there is a relationship between the variables. It is also possible to see, if the relationship is weak or strong and if there is a positive, negative or sometimes even no relationship. You can visualize correlation in many different ways, here we will have a look at the following visualizations:\n\n* Scatter Plot\n* Scatter Plot Matrix\n* Line chart\n* Correlogram\n\n\n'''A note on calculating the correlation coefficient:'''\nGenerally, there are three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient: Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's rank coefficient. \n'''Pearson's correlation coefficient''' is the most popular among them. This measure only allows the input of continuous data and is sensitive to linear relationships. \nWhile Pearson's correlation coefficient is a parametric measure, the other two are non-parametric methods based on ranks. Therefore, they are more sensitive to non-linear relationships and measure the monotonic association - either positive or negative. '''Spearman's rank correlation''' coefficient calculates the rank order of the variables' values using a monotonic function whereas '''Kendall's rank correlation coefficient''' computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks introducing concordant and discordant pairs.\nSince Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most frequently used one among the correlation coefficients, the examples shown later based on this correlation method.\n\n== Scatter Plot ==\n=== Definition ===\nScatter plots are easy to build and the right way to go, if you have two numeric variables. They show every observation as a dot in the graph and the further the dots scatter, the less they explain. The position of the dot on the x- and y-axis represent the values of the two numeric variables.\n[[File:MilesHorsePower2.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n\n=== R Code ===\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n#Plotting the scatter plot\nplot(x = mtcars$mpg,\n     y = mtcars$hp,\n     main = \"Correlation between Miles per Gallon and Horsepower\",\n     xlab = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n     ylab = \"Horsepower\",\n     pch = 16,\n     col = \"red\",\n     las = 1,\n     xlim = c(min(mtcars$mpg), max(mtcars$mpg)),\n     ylim = c(min(mtcars$hp), max(mtcars$hp)))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn this scatter plot you can easily recognize a strong negative relationship between the variables \u201cmpg\u201d and \u201chp\u201d from the \u201cmtcars\u201d dataset.

In this example, the following parameters were defined:\n\n* '''x:''' variable, that will be displayed on the x-axis.\n* '''y:''' variable, that will be displayed on the y-axis.\n* '''xlab:''' title for the x-axis.\n* '''ylab:''' title for the y-axis.\n* '''pch:''' shape and size of the plotted observations, in this case, filled circles. [http:\/\/www.sthda.com\/english\/wiki\/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r Here] you can find an overview of the different possibilities.\n* '''col:''' plotting color.

A convenient way to visualize multiple variables in a scatter plot matrix is offered by the PerformanceAnalytics package. To access the scatter plot matrix from this package, you have to install the package and import the library. After doing that, you can start to select the variables which will be displayed in the plot.\n\n=== R Code ===\n[[File:Scatterplotmatrix.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.2]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.2\nlibrary(PerformanceAnalytics)\n\n# Now calling the chart.Correlation() function and defining a few parameters.\ndata <- mtcars[, c(1,3,4,6,7)]\nchart.Correlation(data, histogram = TRUE)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n\nThe scatter plot matrix from this package is already very nice by default. It splits the plot into an upper, lower and diagonal part. The upper part consists of the correlation coefficients for the different variables. The red stars show you the results of the implemented correlation test. There is a range from zero to three stars and the higher the number of stars, the higher is the significance of the results for the test. In the diagonal part of the plot are histograms for every variable and show you the distribution of the variable. The bivariate scatter plots can be found on the lower part of the plot and contain a fitted line by default.\n\n\n== Line chart ==\n=== Definition ===\nA line chart can help show how quantitative values for different categories have changed over time. They are typically structured around a temporal x-axis with equal intervals from the earliest to latest point in time. Quantitative values are plotted using joined-up lines that effectively connect consecutive points positioned along a y-axis. The resulting slopes formed between the two ends of each line provide an indication of the local trends between points in time. As this sequence is extended to plot all values across the time frame it forms an overall line representative of the quantitative change over time story for a single categorical value."],"14":["This trend in citizen participation is supported by technical development making bird identification easier through the usage of identification apps. Smartphone apps such as \u201ceBirds\u201d help to identify species and also upload photos and the location where the individual was observed. This leads to a growing global online-community of bird watchers who create new data points in observation databases that scientists and environmentalists can make use of for conservation research or planning. For instance, in Canada, the number of people submitting photos to eBirds increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020 (8).\n\nBecause many bird watchers are novices, bird identification is not always carried out correctly. This is a general problem of citizen science. In the case of eBirds, bird experts volunteer as reviewers who check photos for correct determination, especially in the case of rare species that are uncommon in a certain area. This increases the quality of the data (8). However, a study conducted in the UK has shown that citizen science data may be reliable only for widespread and common species, even with many data points and a good coverage of the area (9). \n\nScientists hope that [[Citizen_Science|citizen science]] data may fill data gaps, for instance in the tropics. However, comparisons to data from Bird Life International have shown that the bird abundances for rare species in the tropics are strongly over-estimated. A likely reason is that bird observers are very determined to find these rare species and thereby overlook or under-record more common species and focus on rare ones (10). \nNevertheless, as technology progresses, identification apps are becoming better and easier to use. Moreover, scientists are working on new approaches to include such data into their research in meaningful ways. This trend of increasing citizen participation is thus likely to continue.\n\nTelemetry is another method that was further developed in recent years, although it has been used already for decades in wildlife ecology. Telemetry is \u201cthe system of determining information about an animal through the use of radio signals from or to a device carried by the animal\u201d (11). For birds, this method can be applied in areas ranging in size from restricted breeding territories of resident bird species to movement patterns of international migratory species. Also, the distribution patterns of infectious diseases of migratory species can be tracked (11). However, for some birds, negative effects on nesting behavior were observed (12). \n\n== Key publications ==\n=== Theoretical ===\n\nFuller, R. J., & Langslow, D. R. (1984).

Based on the mean and standard deviation of the data, a probability results for each point of the recording that belongs to this normal distribution. Using the so-called Chauvenet criterion, a lower limit can be defined below which a point is marked as an outlier. If the Chauvenet criterion is set to 0.5, all points that belong to the normal distribution of the data with a probability of less than 0.5% are recognized as outliers. Depending on how high the criterion is set, the number of detected outliers changes accordingly (this is illustrated in figure 3). How high the optimal limit is, i.e. to which value the Chauvenet criterion must be set, depends on the further goal and is often only determined over time. This approach is closely related to the Z-score, which is a measure of the deviation of a point from the mean of a standardized normal distribution.\nThe Chauvenet criterion can be applied to both univariate and multivariate data, offering the possibility to apply outlier detection either to single attributes or to a combination of attributes.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\n# Set the quantiles and get the respective values\nlower_q, upper_q = 0.02, 0.98## determine the qyartule thresholds.\nlower_value = data['z'].quantile(lower_q)## apply the lower threshold to dataset.\nupper_value = data['z'].quantile(upper_q)## apply the upper threshold to dataset.\n\n# Plot the results\ndef univariate_chauvenet(data_points: np.ndarray, criterion: float = None):\n    # Calculate mean and std of the data\n    mean = data_points.mean()\n    std = data_points.std()\n\n    # Calculate the criterion based on the number of points if not provided\n    if criterion is None:\n        criterion = 1.0\/(2 * len(data_points)) ## criterion is set to 1 divided 2 times the length of the data set.\n\n    # Calculate the absolute deviation and scale by std\n    deviation = np.abs(data_points - mean) \/ std\n\n    # Calculate the probabilities using erfc and return the mask.

It works by measuring the local deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors, and it compares this deviation to the average deviation of the neighbors. A data point that has a significantly higher deviation than its neighbors is considered to be an outlier. By choosing the number of neighbors to consider, the number of outliers and their positioning within the data distribution is affected (see figure five).\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(16, 5))## create plot with three sub-plots\nfig.suptitle('Neighbor-Based Outlier Detection', size=20)\nfor i, n in enumerate([5, 10, 20]):## the number determines how many neighbored data points are considered\n    lof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=n)\n    mask = lof.fit_predict(data[['y', 'z']])\n    sns.scatterplot(data=data, x='y', y='z', hue=np.where(mask==1, 'No Outlier', 'Outlier'), ax=axs[i])\n    axs[i].set(title=f'Neighbors = {n} with {sum(mask == -1)} Outliers')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:Outliers 5.png|900px]]\n\n''Figure 5: Outliers detected with the neighbor-based method'' \n\n==What to do with Outliers==\nThe methods presented provide information about which data points are very likely to be outliers and show strong differences from the majority of the data set.

They also found that \"[d]isagreeing with the rest of the group increased the probability of adopting a new opinion, which was usually an improvement\" (p.322) and that the Delphi process \"clearly outperformed simple trend extrapolations based on the assumption that the growth rates observed in the past will continue in the future\", which they had calculated prior to the Delphi (p.324). Based on the post-Delphi survey answers, and the results for the 15 variables, the researchers further inferred that \"paying attention to each others' answers made the forecasts more accurate\" (p.320), and that the participants were well able to assess the accuracy of their own estimates. The researchers calculated many more measures and a comparison to a non-Delphi forecasting round, which you can read more about in the publication. Overall, this example shows that the Delphi method works in that it leads to more accurate results over time, and that the process itself helps individuals better forecast than traditional forecasts would.\n\n\n== Key Publications ==\n* Linstone, H.

To this end, Caniglia et al. (2020) suggest three types of knowledge that should be developed and incorporated by Sustainability Science:\n[[File:Types of knowledge for action-oriented sustainability science.png|900px|thumb|center|'''Types of knowledge for action-oriented sustainability science.''' Source: Caniglia et al. 2020, p.4]]\n\nThis showcases that this knowledge - and more importantly - the perspective from a philosophy-of-science viewpoint is only starting to emerge, and much more work will be needed until our methodological canon and the knowledge we want to produce enable us to solve the problems we are facing, but also to create these solution in ways that are closer to a mode how we want to create these solutions. We may well be able to solve certain things, and to produce knowledge that can be seen as solutions. I would however argue, that it also matters how we create these solutions and how we create knowledge. Only if people are empowered and society and science work seamlessly together - with ethical restrictions and guidelines in place, of course - will we not only produce the knowledge needed, but we also produce it in a way how we should as scientists. '''Science is often disconnected and even arrogant, and building an educational system that is reflexive and interconnected will be maybe the largest challenge we face.''' This is why we give you these criteria here, because I think that we need to consider what further design criteria can be in order to enhance and diversify our conceptual thinking about the scientific methodological canon. Plurality on scientific methods will necessarily mean to evolve, and in this age of interconnectedness, our journey is only beginning.\n\n== Interaction with stakeholders == \nScientific methods can engage with non-scientific actors on diverse levels, depending on the extent of their involvement in the process of scientific inquiry. Interaction with stakeholder may be especially relevant in [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] research. \n<br\/>'''Here, we refer to four levels of interaction:'''\n* ''Information'': Stakeholders are informed about scientific insights, possibly in form of policy recommendations that make the knowledge actionable. This is the most common form of science-society cooperation.\n* ''Consultation'': A one-directional information flow from practice actors (stakeholders) to academia, most commonly in form of questionnaires and interviews, which provides input or feedback to proposed or active research. Stakeholders provide information, which is of interest to the researchers, but are not actively involved in the research process.\n* ''Collaboration'': Stakeholders cooperate with academia, e.g. through one of the aforementioned methods, in order to jointly frame and solve a distinct issue.\n* ''Empowerment'': The highest form of involvement of non-scientific actors in research, where marginalized or suppressed stakeholders are given authority and ownership to solve problems themselves, and\/or are directly involved in the decision-making process at the collaboration level. Empowerment surpasses mere collaboration since stakeholders are enabled to engage with existing problems themselves, rather than relying on research for each individual issue anew.\n\nYou can find more on these four categories in Brandt et al 2013, where a general introduction to the research landscape of transdisciplinary research in sustainability science is given. More will follow later on such approaches, and so much more still has to follow in science overall, since the declared distinction of science being in an ivory tower is only slowly crumbling. We need to question this [[Levels of Theory|paradigm]], and [[Questioning the status quo in methods|be critical of the status quo of normal science]]. More knowledge is needed, and especially, different knowledge.\n\n== References ==\n* Wiek et al. 2011. ''Key competencies in sustainability: a reference framework for academic program development''.

It summarizes key developments in science and introduces vital concepts and considerations for academic inquiry. It also engages with thoughts on the future of science in view of the challenges of our time. Each chapter includes some general thoughts on the respective topic as well as relevant Wiki entries.\n\n__TOC__\n<br\/>\n=== Definition & History of Methods ===\n'''Epochs of scientific methods'''\nThe initial lecture presents a rough overview of the history of science on a shoestring, focussing both on philosophy as well as - more specifically - philosophy of science. Starting with the ancients we focus on the earliest preconditions that paved the way towards the historical development of scientific methods. \n\n'''Critique of the historical development and our status quo'''\nWe have to recognise that modern science is a [[Glossary|system]] that provides a singular and non-holistic worldview, and is widely built on oppression and inequalities. Consequently, the scientific system per se is flawed as its foundations are morally questionable, and often lack the necessary link between the empirical and the ethical consequences of science. Critical theory and ethics are hence the necessary precondition we need to engage with as researchers continuously.\n\n'''Interaction of scientific methods with philosophy and society'''\nScience is challenged: while our scientific knowledge is ever-increasing, this knowledge is often kept in silos, which neither interact with other silos nor with society at large. Scientific disciplines should not only orientate their wider focus and daily interaction more strongly towards society, but also need to reintegrate the humanities in order to enable researchers to consider the ethical conduct and consequences of their research. \n\n* [[History of Methods]]\n* [[History of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Methods in science ===\nA great diversity of methods exists in science, and no overview that is independent from a disciplinary bias exists to date. One can get closer to this by building on the core design criteria of scientific methods. \n\n'''Quantitative vs. qualitative'''\nThe main differentiation within the methodological canon is often between quantitative and qualitative methods. This difference is often the root cause of the deep entrenchment between different disciplines and subdisciplines. Numbers do count, but they can only tell you so much. There is a clear difference between the knowledge that is created by either qualitative or qualitative methods, hence the question of better or worse is not relevant. Instead it is more important to ask which knowledge would help to create the most necessary knowledge under the given circumstances.\n\n'''Inductive vs. deductive'''\nSome branches of science try to verify or falsify hypotheses, while other branches of science are open towards the knowledge being created primarily from the data. Hence the difference between a method that derives [[Glossary|theory]] from data, or one that tests a theory with data, is often exclusive to specific branches of science. To this end, out of the larger availability of data and the already existing knowledge we built on so far, there is a third way called abductive reasoning. This approach links the strengths of both [[Glossary|induction]] and [[Glossary|deduction]] and is certainly much closer to the way how much of modern research is actually conducted. \n\n'''Scales'''\nCertain scientific methods can transcend spatial and temporal scales, while others are rather exclusive to a specific partial or temporal scale. While again this does not make one method better than another, it is certainly relevant since certain disciplines almost focus exclusively on specific parts of scales. For instance, psychology or population ecology are mostly preoccupied with the individual, while macro-economics widely work on a global scale. Regarding time there is an ever increasing wealth of past information, and a growing interest in knowledge about the future. This presents a shift from a time when most research focused on the presence. \n\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods]]\n* [[Design Criteria of Methods (German)]]\n\n=== Critical Theory & Bias ===\n'''Critical theory'''\nThe rise of empiricism and many other developments of society created critical theory, which questioned the scientific [[Glossary|paradigm]], the governance of systems as well as democracy, and ultimately the norms and truths not only of society, but more importantly of science. This paved the road to a new form of scientific practice, which can be deeply normative, and ultimately even transformative.  \n\n'''The pragmatism of [[Glossary|bias]]'''\nCritical theory raised the alarm to question empirical inquiry, leading to an emerging recognition of bias across many different branches of science. With a bias being, broadly speaking, a tendency for or against a specific construct (cultural group, social group etc.), various different forms of bias may flaw our recognition, analysis or interpretation, and many forms of bias are often deeply contextual, highlighting the presence or dominance of constructed groups or knowledge. \n\n'''Limitations in science'''\nRooted in critical theory, and with a clear recognition of bias, science(s) need to transform into a reflexive, inclusive and solution-oriented domain that creates knowledge jointly with and in service of society. The current scientific paradigms are hence strongly questioned, reflecting the need for new societal paradigms. \n\n* [[Bias and Critical Thinking]]\n* [[Bias and Critical Thinking (German)]]\n\n=== Experiment & Hypothesis ===\n'''The scientific method?'''\nThe testing of a [[Glossary|hypothesis]] was a breakthrough in scientific thinking. Another breakthrough came with Francis Bacon who proclaimed the importance of observation to derive conclusions. This paved the road for repeated observation under conditions of manipulation, which in consequence led to carefully planned systematic methodological designs. \n\n'''Forming hypotheses'''\nOften based on previous knowledge or distinct higher laws or assumptions, the formulation of hypotheses became an important step towards systematic inquiry and carefully designed experiments that still constitute the baseline of modern medicine, psychology, ecology and many other fields. Understanding the formulation of hypotheses and how they can be falsified or confirmed is central for large parts of science. Hypotheses can be tested, are ideally parsimonious - thus build an existing knowledge - and the results should be reproducible and transferable. \n\n'''Limitations of hypothesis'''\nThese criteria of hypotheses showcase that despite allowing for a systematic and - some would say - \u2018causal\u2019 form of knowledge, hypotheses are rigid at best, and offer a rather static worldview at their worst. Theories explored in hypothesis testing should be able to match the structures of experiments. Therefore, the underlying data is constructed, which limits the possibilities of this knowledge production approach.\n\n* [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing]]\n* [[Experiments and Hypothesis Testing (German)]]\n\n=== Causality & Correlation ===\n'''Defining causality'''\nBuilding on the criteria from David Hume, we define causality through temporal links (\"if this - then this\"), as well as through similarities and dissimilarities. If A and B cause C, then there must be some characteristic that makes A and B similar, and this similarity causes C. If A causes C, but B does not cause C, then there must be a dissimilarity between A and B. Causal links can be clearly defined, and it is our responsibility as scientists to build on this understanding, and understand its limitations. \n\n'''Understanding correlations''' Correlations statistically test the relation between two continuous variables. A relation that - following probability - is not a coincidence but from a statistical standpoint meaningful, can be called a significant correlation. \n\n'''The difference between causality and correlation'''\nWith increasing statistical analysis being conducted, we sometimes may find significant correlations that are non-causal. Disentangling causal form correlative relations is deeply normative and needs to acknowledge that we often build science based on deeply constructed ontologies."],"20":["'''The system is at the basis of System Thinking.''' System Thinking is a form of scientific approach to organizing and understanding 'systems' as well as solving questions related to them. It can be said that every creation of a (scientific) model of a system is an expression of System Thinking, but there is more to System Thinking than just building and working with system models (1). System Thinking revolves around the notion of 'holistic' understanding, i.e. the idea that the components of a system can best be understood by also observing adjacent components and attempting to understand their connections. Among diverging definitions of the term, recurring characteristics of System Thinking are the acknowledgement of non-linear interrelationships between system elements, including [[Glossary|feedback loop]]s, that lead to dynamic behavior of the system and make it necessary to examine the whole system instead of only its parts (6). Further, System Thinking assumes that \"(...) all system dynamics are in principle non-linear\" and that \"(...) only non-linear equations are capable of describing systems that follow non-equililbrium conditions\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.6).\n\n'''Peter Checkland introduced the notion that there are two main types of System Thinking:''' hard and soft. Hard System Thinking (HST) includes the earlier forms of applied System Thinking that could be found in technology management or engineering. It assumes that the analyzed system is objectively real and in itself systemic, that it can be understood and modeled in a reductionist approach and intervened by an external observer to optimize a problematic situation. HST is defined by understanding the world as a system that has a clear structure, a single set of underlying values and norms and a specific goal (9). We could think of a machine as a 'system' in this sense.\n\nSoft System Thinking (SST), by comparison, considers a 'system' an \"(...) epistemological concept which is subjectively constructed by people rather the objective entities in the world\" (Zexian & Xuhui 2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9). In SST, the observer interacts with the system they observe and cannot optimize it, but improve it through active involvement. In this view, a social organisation could be a 'system'.\n\n[[File:Causal Loop Diagram - Hard vs Soft.png|450px|thumb|right|'''Hard System Thinking and Soft System Thinking''' according to Checkland. Source: Checkland 2000, p.18]]\n\nSystem Thinking (especially HST) finds concrete applications in science through two concepts that it builds upon: ''System Analysis'' and ''System Dynamics'' (1).\n\n''System Analysis'' \"(...) is about discovering organisational structures in systems and creating insights into the organisation of causalities. It is about taking a problem apart and reassembling it in order to understand its components and feedback relationships.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). ''System Analysis'', thus, focuses on understanding the system and being able to recreate it. This is often done through the application of Causal Loop Diagrams, which will be explained below. For more information, refer to the entry on [[System Analysis]].\n\n''System Dynamics'', then, focuses on the interaction part of the system. It \"(...) refers to the re-creation of the understanding of a system and its feedbacks. It aims at exploring dynamic responses to changes within or from outside the system. (...) System Dynamics deals with mathematical representation of our mental models and is a secondary step after we have developed our mental model.\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.5). System Dynamics, as the name suggests, enables the researcher to observe and measure the behavior of the system. The interactions between the individual elements are not just recreated, but the consequences of these interactions are quantified and assessed.\n\nSystem Thinking allows for a shift in the perception of [[Causality|causality]]. Instead of assuming linear causality (A causes B, B causes C) it allows for the integration of further influencing factors, as well as a more neutral depiction of the system at hand. C may now be seen as a property that [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|emerges]] from the relation between A and B, instead of perceiving it as a direct consequence of B. Haraldsson (2004, p.21) provides an illustrative example here: \"We start by asking the initial question: \"I want to understand how water flows into the glass and what I do to fill it up.\" Instead of looking at the action from an individual point of view, where the \"I am\" is the active part and at the centre of focus, we shift our perception to the structure of the action. The \"I am\" simply becomes a part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. Suddenly we have shifted out attention to the structure of the behavior and we can observe that the structure is causing the behavior. (...) We have now transformed the traditional linear thinking into a circular argument.\"\n\n==== Causal Loop Diagrams ====\nCausal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) are a crucial method for System Analysis since they allow for the modelling of systems. They make it possible \"(...) to 'map' the complexity of a problem of interest\" (McGlashan et al. 2016, p.2). A CLD allows us to not suppose a linear relationship between system elements, but rather understand cause and effect (1). It makes it possible to \"(...) understand how a behavior has been manifesting itself in a system so we can develop strategies to work with, or counteract the behavior. We also want to know to what extent and how the problem is connected with other 'systems'\" (Haraldsson 2004, p.20). By developing a CLD, one can visualize and thus better understand the feedback mechanisms that happen in a system (1). Therefore, they enable both a look at the structure as well as the processes in a system. The CLD also helps transfer system understanding (1). CLDs \"(...) provide a language for articulating our understanding of the dynamic, interconnected nature of our world. (...) By stringing together several loops, we can create a coherent story about a particular problem or issue.\" (Team TIP 2011, p.1)\n\n'''A Causal Loop Diagram consists of rather few elements:''' Variables, Causal Relationships and Polarity.\n\n'''Variables''' represent the individual elements of a system, but are adapted to the research intent underlying the creation of the CLD. They are \"(...) dynamic causes or effects of the problem under study\" (McGlashan et al. 2016, p.2). For example, in a CLD that recreates a forest ecosystem, the system element may be the soil, whereas the variable that we use in the CLD would be, for example, the change in the amount of carbon in the soil - if this is of interest for the research.\n\nBetween these variables, the CLD depicts '''causal relationships'''. Causal relationships \"(...) are represented by arrows that represent a directed cause from one variable to another\" (McGlashan et al. 2016, p.2). When a number of causal relationships (i.e. arrows) connects two or more variables to a circular structure, a loop constitutes."],"21":["{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\"\n! colspan = \"4\" | Type !! colspan = \"4\" | Team Size\n|-\n| [[:Category:Collaborative Tools|Collaborative Tools]] || [[:Category:Software|Software]] || '''[[:Category:Personal Skills|Personal Skills]]''' || '''[[:Category:Productivity Tools|Productivity Tools]]''' || '''[[:Category:Team Size 1|1]]''' || [[:Category:Team Size 2-10|2-10]] || [[:Category:Team Size 11-30|11-30]] || [[:Category:Team Size 30+|30+]]\n|}\n\n== What, Why & When ==\n\n''Teaching is the best way to learn.''\n\nThe Feynman Method, named after famous physician Richard Feynman, is a learning technique that builds on the idea that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it. This approach helps us better understand what we are learning, and not just memorize technical terms. This way, we can more easily transfer our new knowledge to unknown situations.\n\n== Goals ==\n* Obtain a profound understanding of any topic.\n* Learn more quickly and with more depth.\n* Become able to explain any given topic to anyone.\n\n== Getting Started ==\nThe Feynman method is a simple, circular process:\n\n# '''Select the topic you want to learn more about.''' This can be something you need to learn for an exam, or something you are just interested in knowing more about. Don't go to broad - focus on a specific topic. You will not be able to explain \"Economics\" or \"Physics\" in one go.\n# '''Find someone to talk to'''. Ideally, this person does not know anything about this topic. If you don't have someone to talk to, you can also just speak out loud to yourself, or write your presentation down. Start explaining the topic in simple terms.\n# '''Make notes.''' You will quickly realize yourself which parts of the topic you are not able to explain, and\/or have not understood yourself. You might feel bad for a moment, but this step is important - it prevents you from pretending to yourself that you understood everything, when in fact you did not. Write down what you do not understand sufficiently! If you get feedback on which parts you did not properly explain, write this down, too. Lastly, write down where you used very technical, specific terms, even if your audience might have understood them. Someone else might not, and you should be able to do without them.\n# '''Have a look at your notes and try to find more information.''' Read scientific publications, Wikipedia entries or dedicated books; watch documentaries or YouTube videos - have a look at everything that may help you better understand the topic, and fill your knowledge gaps. Pay attention to the technical terms that you used, and find better ways to explain these things without relying on the terms.\n# '''Now explain the topic again.''' Possibly you can speak to the same person as previously. Did they understood you better now? Were you able to explain also those parts that you could not properly explain before? There will likely still be some gaps, or unclear spots in your explanation. This is why the Feynman method is circular: go back to the second step of taking notes, and repeat until you can confidently explain the topic to anyone, and they will understand it. Now you have also understood it.

Within a block experiment we may want to check how much variance is explained on a block level. In a nested experiment, the explained variance among all levels should be preferably checked. \nIn a last step, it could be beneficial to check the residuals across all factor levels. While this is often hampered by a smaller sample size, it might be helpful to understand the behaviour of the model, especially when initial inspection in a boxplot showed flaws or skews in the distribution.\n\n==Fixed effects vs. Random effects==\n[[File:Smoking trooper.jpg|thumb|right|If smoking is a fixed or a random effect depends on the study design]]\nWithin [[ANOVA]] designs, the question whether a variable is a [https:\/\/web.ma.utexas.edu\/users\/mks\/statmistakes\/fixedvsrandom.html fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider. Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables. To this end, it is helpful to consult existing studies to differentiate between [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vb0GvznHf8U random and fixed factors]. Current medical trials may consider many variables, and have to take even more random factors into account. Testing the impact of random factors on the raw data is often a first step when looking at initial data, yet this does not help if it is a purely deductive design. In this case, simplified pre-tests are often a first step to make initial attempts to understand the system and also check whether variables - both fixed or random - are feasible and can be utilised in the respective design. Initial pre-tests at such smaller scales are a typical approach in medical research, yet other branches of research reject them as being too unsystematic. Fisher himself championed small sample designs, and we would encourage pre-tests in field experiments if at all possible. Later flaws and errors in the design can be prevented, although form a statistical standpoint the value of such pre-tests may be limited at best.\n\n==Unexplained variance==\n[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|left|Karl Popper emphasised that facts can only be approximated, i.e. are only considered to be true as long as they are not falsified.]]\n[[File:Ronald Fisher.jpg|thumb|right|Fisher's approach of considering the variance of the real world in statistics can be seen as perfectly complementary to Popper's epistemological reflections.]]\nAcknowledging unexplained variance was a breakthrough in modern science, as we should acknowledge that understanding a phenomena fairly well now is better than understanding something perfectly, but never. In a sense was the statistical developing of uncertainty reflected in philosophical theory, as [https:\/\/sustainabilitymethods.org\/index.php\/Hypothesis_building#Testing_of_hypothesis Karl Popper] highlighted the imperfection of experiments in testing or falsification of theories. Understanding the limitations of the scientific endeavour thus became an important baseline, and the scientific experiments tried partly to take this into account through recognising the limitations of the result. What is however often confused is whether the theory is basically imperfect - hence the results are invalid or implausible - or whether the experiment was conducted in an imperfect sense, making the results unreliable. The imperfection to understand the difference between flaws in theory and flaws in conducting the experiment is a continuous challenge of modern science. When looking at unexplained variance, we always have to consider that our knowledge can be limited through theory and empirical conduct, and these two flaws are not clearly separated. Consequently, unexplained variance remains a blank in our knowledge, and should always be highlighted as such. As much as it is important to acknowledge what we know, it is at least equally important to highlight what we do not know.\n\n==Interpretation of field experiments==\nInterpreting results from field experiments demands experience. First of all, we shall interpret the p-value, and check which treatments and interactions are significant. Here, many researchers argue that we should report the full model, yet I would disagree. P-values in ANOVA summaries differ between the so called full models -which include all predictors- and minimum adequate models -which thrive to be the most parsimonious models. Model reduction is essential, as the changing p-values may make a difference between models that are reporting true results, or flawed probabilities that vaporize once the non-significant terms are subsequently reduced. Therefore, one by one we need to minimize the model in its complexity, and reduce the model until it only contains significant interaction terms as well as the maybe even non-significant single terms, which we have to include if the interaction is significant. This will give us a clear idea which treatments have a significant effect on the dependent variable. \nSecond, when expecting model results we should interpret the sum of squares, thereby evaluating how much of the respective treatment is explain the effect of the dependent variable. While this is partly related to the p-value, it is also important to note how much variance is explained by potential block factors. In addition, it is also important to notice how much remains unexplained in total, as this residual variance indicates how much we do not understand using this experimental approach. This is extremely related to the specific context, and we need to be aware that knowledge of previous studies may aid us in understanding the value of our contribution. \nLastly, we need to take further flaws into our considerations when interpreting results from field experiments. Are there extreme outliers. How do the residuals look like? Is any treatment level showing signs of an uneven distribution or gaps? Do the results seem to be representative? We need to be very critical of our own results, and always consider that the results reflect only a part of reality."],"23":["==Replication of experiments==\n[[File:Bildschirmfoto 2020-05-21 um 17.10.27.png|thumb|One famous example from the discipline of psychology is the Milgram shock experiment carried out by Stanley Milgram a professor from the Yale University in 1963.]]\nField experiments became a revolution for many scientific fields. The systematic testing of hypotheses allowed first for [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ronald_Fisher#Rothamsted_Experimental_Station,_1919%E2%80%931933 agriculture] and [https:\/\/revisesociology.com\/2016\/01\/17\/field-experiments-sociology\/ other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions. This systematic generation of knowledge triggered a revolution in science, as knowledge became subsequently more specific and detailed. Take antibiotics, where a wide array of remedies was successively developed and tested. This triggered the cascading effects of antibiotic resistance, demanding new and updated versions to keep track with the bacteria that are likewise constantly evolving. This showcases that while the field experiment led to many positive developments, it also created ripples that are hard to anticipate. There is an overall crisis in complex experiments that is called replication crisis. What is basically meant by that is that some possibilities to replicate the results of studies -often also of landmark papers- failed spectacularly. In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to this end, and we are only starting to explore this possibility in other arenas. However, we need to be aware that also when we add complexity to our research designs, especially in field experiments the possibility of replication diminished, since we may not take factors into account that we are unaware of.

Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page."],"26":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Heatmaps. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nA heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual numerical values are substituted with colored cells. In other words, it is a table with colors in place of numbers. As in the regular table, in the heatmap, each column is a feature and each row is an observation.\n\n==Why use a heatmap?==\nHeatmaps are useful to get an overall understanding of the data. While it can be hard to look at the table of numbers it is much easier to perceive the colors. Thus it can be easily seen which value is larger or smaller in comparison to others and how they are generally distributed.\n\n==Color assignment and normalization of data==\nThe principle by which the colors in a heatmap are assigned is that all the values of the table are ranked from the highest to lowest and then segregated into bins. Each bin is then assigned a particular color. However, in the case of the small datasets, colors might be assigned based on the values themselves and not on the bins. Usually, for higher value, the color is more intense or darker, and for the smaller is paler or lighter, depending on which color palette is chosen.\n\nIt is important to remember that since each feature in a dataset does not always have the same scale of measurement, usually the normalization (scaling) of data is required. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric rows and\/or columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\n\nIt also means that if our data are not normalized, we can compare each value with any other by color across the whole heatmap. However, if the data are normalized, then the color is assigned based on the relative values in the row or column, and therefore each value can be compared with others only in their corresponding row or column, while the same color in a different row\/column will not have the same value behind it or belong to the same bin.\n\n==R Code==\nTo build the heatmap we will use the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function and '''mtcars''' dataset.\nIt is important to note that the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heatmap()<\/syntaxhighlight> function only takes a numeric matrix of the values as data for plotting. Therefore we need to check if our dataset only includes numbers and then transform our dataset into a matrix, using <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>as.matrix()<\/syntaxhighlight> function.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\ndata(\"mtcars\")\nmatcars <- as.matrix(mtcars)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nAlso, for better representation, we are going to rename the columns, giving them their full names. It is not a mandatory step, but it makes our heatmap more comprehensible.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nfullcolnames <- c(\"Miles per Gallon\", \"Number of Cylinders\",\n                  \"Displacement\", \"Horsepower\", \"Rear Axle Ratio\",\n                  \"Weight\", \"1\/4 Mile Time\", \"Engine\", \"Transmission\",\n                  \"Number of Gears\", \"Number of Carburetors\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nNow we are using the transformed dataset (matcars) to create the heatmap. Other used arguments are explained below.\n[[File:Heatmap.png|350px|thumb|right|Fig.1]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\nheatmap(matcars, Colv = NA, Rowv = NA, \n        scale = \"column\", labCol = fullcolnames, \n        margins = c(11,5))\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n== How to interpret a heatmap? ==\n\nIn the default color palette the interpretation is usually the following: the darker the color the higher the responding value, and vice versa. For example, let\u2019s look at the feature <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>\u201cNumber of Carburetors\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight>. We can see that '''Maserati Bora''' has the darkest color, hence it has the largest number of carburetors, followed by '''Ferrari Dino''', which has the second-largest number of carburetors. While other models such as '''Fiat X1-9''' or '''Toyota''' have the lightest colors. It means that they have the lowest numbers of carburetors. This interpretation can be applied to every other column.\n\n==Explanation of used arguments==\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Colv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>Rowv = NA<\/syntaxhighlight> are used to remove the dendrograms from rows and columns. A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects and is added on top of the heatmap by default if the argument is not specified. The main reason for removing it here is that it is a different method of data visualisation which is not mandatory for the heatmap representation and requires a separate article to review it fully.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>scale = \u201ccolumn\u201d<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to normalize the columns of the matrix (to absorb the variation between columns). As it was stated previously, normalization is needed due to the algorithm by which the colors are set. Here in our dataset, the values of features \u201cGross horsepower\u201d and \u201cDisplacement\u201d are much larger than the rest. Therefore, without normalization, these two columns will be all marked approximately equally high and all the other columns equally low. Normalizing means that we keep the relative values in each column but not the real numbers. In the interpretation sense it means that, for example, the same color of features \u201cMiles per Gallon\u201d and \u201cNumber of Cylinders\u201d of Mazda RX4 does not mean that the actual values are the same or approximately the same (placed in the same bin). It only means that the relative values of each of these cells in corresponding columns are the same or are in the same bin.\n* <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>margins<\/syntaxhighlight> is used to fit the columns and rows names into the graph. The reason we used it here is because of the renaming of the columns, which is resulted in longer names that did not fit well by themselves.\n\nColoring options for the heatmap\nThe choice of color for the heatmap is one of the most important aspects of creating an understandable and nice-looking representation of the data. If you do not specify the color (as in the example above) then the default color palette will be applied. However, you can use the argument <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>col<\/syntaxhighlight> and choose from a wide variety of palettes for coloring your heatmap.\n\nThere are two options of setting a color palette for the heatmap:\n* First option is to use the palettes from R: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>cm.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>heat.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>rainbow()<\/syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>terrain.color()<\/syntaxhighlight>  or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>topo.colors()<\/syntaxhighlight> \n* The second option is to install color palettes packages such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>RColorBrewer<\/syntaxhighlight>"],"27":["Viele konkrete Schritte brachten uns der konkreten Anwendung wissenschaftlicher Methoden n\u00e4her, darunter - insbesondere - der Ansatz des kontrollierten Testens durch den arabischen Mathematiker und Astronomen [https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/biography\/Ibn-al-Haytham Alhazen (a.k.a.

They are a bit over simplistic if they contain only one level of information such as three groups and their abundance, and can be more advanced if they contain two levels of information such as in stacked barplots. These can be shown as either absolute numbers or proportions, which may make a dramatic difference for the analysis or interpretation.\n\n'''Correlation plots''' ('xyplots') are the next staple in statistical graphics and most often the graphical representation of a correlation. Further, often also a regression is implemented to show effect strengths and variance. Fitting a [[Regression Analysis|regression]] line is often the most important visual aid to showcase the trend. Through point size or color can another information level be added, making this a really powerful tool, where one needs to keep a keen eye on the relation between correlation and causality. Such plots may also serve to show fluctuations in data over time, showing trends within data as well as harmonic patterns.\n\n'''Boxplots''' are the last in what I would call the trinity of statistical figures. Showing the variance of continuous data across different factor levels is what these plots are made of. While histograms reveal more details and information, boxplots are a solid graphical representation of the Analysis of Variance. A rule of thumb is that if one box is higher or lower than the median (the black line) of the other box, the difference may be signifiant.\n\n[[File:Xyplot.png|250px|thumb|left|'''A Correlation plot.'''

They can help reveal a lot of useful information about numerical data with a single explanatory variable. Histograms are used for getting a sense about the distribution of data, its median, and skewness.\n\nSimple '''pie charts''' are not really ideal, as they camouflage the real proportions of the data they show. '''Venn diagrams''' are a simple way to compare 2-4 groups and their overlaps, allowing for multiple hits. Larger co-connections can either be represented by a '''bipartite plot''', if the levels are within two groups, or, if multiple interconnections exist, then a '''structural equation model''' representation is valuable for more deductive approaches, while rather inductive approaches can be shown by '''circular network plots''' (aka [[Chord Diagram]]).\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Venn Diagram example.png|200px|thumb|left|'''A Venn Diagram showing the number of articles in a systematic review that revolve around one or more of three topics.'''

Ordination plots may encapsulate such diverse approaches as decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from a non-metric dimensional scaling. Typically, the first two most important axis are shown, and additional information can be added post hoc. While these plots show continuous patterns, cluster dendrogramms show the grouping of data. These plots are often helpful to show hierarchical structures in data. Network plots show diverse interactions between different parts of the data. While these can have underlying statistical analysis embedded, such network plots are often more graphical representations than statistical tests.\n\n[[File:Introduction to Statistical Figures - Ordination example.png|450px|thumb|left|'''An Ordination plot (Principal Component Analysis) in which analyzed villages (colored abbreviations) in Transylvania are located according to their natural capital assets alongside two main axes, explaining 50% and 18% of the variance.'''

Most methods refer to either one or two of these steps, and few methods refer to all three steps. \n* Many specific methods can be differentiated into different schools of thinking, and many methods have finer differentiations or specifications in an often hierarchical fashion. These two factors make a fine but systematic overview of all methods an almost Herculean task, yet on a broader scale it is quite possible to gain an overview of the methodological canon of science within a few years, if you put some efforts into it. This Wiki tries to develop the baseline material for such an overview, yet can of course not replace practical application of methods and the continuous exploring of empirical studies within the scientific literature. \n\n\n=== What can you learn about methods on this Wiki? ===\n'''This Wiki describes each presented method in terms of''' \n* its historical and disciplinary background,\n* its characteristics and how the method actually works,\n* its strengths and challenges,\n* normative implications of the method,\n* the potential future and open questions for the method,\n* exemplary studies that deploy the method,\n* as well as key publications and further readings.\n\nAlso, each scientific method that is described on this Wiki is categorized according to the Wiki's underlying [[Design Criteria of Methods]].<br\/>\n'''This means that each method fulfills one or more categories of each of the following criteria:'''\n<br\/>\n* [[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]] - [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n* [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] - [[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]\n* Spatial scales: [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] - [[:Category:System|System]] - [[:Category:Global|Global]]\n* Temporal scales: [[:Category:Past|Past]] - [[:Category:Present|Present]] - [[:Category:Future|Future]]\nYou can click on each category for more information and all the entries that belong to this category.\n<br\/>\n\n\n=== Which methods can you learn about? ===\nSee all methods that have been described on this Wiki so far:\n<categorytree mode=\"pages\" hideroot=\"on\">Methods<\/categorytree>\n<br>\nWe also have what we call '''Level 2''' overview pages. <br>\nOn these pages, we present everything that is necessary for a specific field of methods in a holistic way.

Source: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Noble_Eightfold_Path Wikipedia], Ian Alexander, CC BY-SA 4.0]]\nMindfulness is a [[Glossary|concept]] with diverse facets. In principle, it aims at clearing your mind to be in the here and now, independent of the normative [[Glossary|assumptions]] that typically form our train of thought. Most people that practice mindfulness have a routine and regular rhythm, and often follow one of the several schools of thinking that exist. Mindfulness has been practiced since thousands of years, already starting before the rise of Buddhism, and in the context of many diverse but often religious schools of thinking.\n\n== Goals ==\nSince the goal of mindfulness is basically having \"no mind\", it is counterintuitive to approach the practice with any clear goal. Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace - Mindfulness.png|300px|thumb|left|'''[https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/de Headspace] is an app that can help you meditate''', which may be a way of practicing Mindfulness for you. Source: Headspace]]\n\nDuring the last decades mindfulness took a strong tooting in the western world, and the commercialisation of the principle of mindfulness led to the development of several approaches and even apps, like Headspace, that can introduce lay people to a regular practice. The Internet contains many resources, yet it should be stressed that such approaches are often far away from the original starting point of mindfulness.\n\nMindfulness has been hyped as yet another self-optimisation tool. However, mindfulness is not an end in itself, but can be seen as a practice of a calm mind. Sweeping the floor is a common metaphor for emptying your mind. Our mind is constantly rambling around \u2013 often referred to as the monkey mind \u2013, but there are several steps to recognise, interact with, train and finally calm your monkey mind (for tips on how to quiet the monkey mind, have a look at [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2017\/02\/28\/8-science-based-tricks-for-quieting-the-monkey-mind\/#6596e6a51af6 this article]). Just like sports, mindfulness exercises are a practice where one gets better over time.\n\nIf you want to establish a mindfulness practice for yourself, you could try out the app Headspace or the aforementioned breathing exercises. Other ideas that you can find online include journaling, doing a body scan, or even Yoga. You could also start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

The focus is on structuring information in a way that provides a good overview of a topic and supports [[Glossary|communication]] and [[Glossary|creativity.]]\n\n== Goals ==\n* Visualise information in an intuitive structure for a good overview of key elements of a topic.\n* Better communicate and structure information for individual and team work.\n\n== Getting started ==\nAlthough this claim is not fully supported by research, the underlying idea of a Mindmap is to mimick the way the brain structures information by creating a map of words, hence the name. Yet indeed, research has indicated that this approach to structuring information is an efficient way of memorizing and understanding information. The Mindmap was created and propagated in the 1970s by Tony Buzan.\n\n[[File:Mindmap Example 2.jpg|600px|thumb|right|'''MindMaps can take the form of trees, with the words on the branches, or clusters\/bubbles, as in this example.''' They can also be visually improved not only through the usage of colors, but also by varying the thickness and length of ties, and using symbols. Source: [https:\/\/www.thetutorteam.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/shutterstock_712786150.jpg thetutorteam.com]]]\n\n'''A Mindmap enables the visual arrangement of various types of information, including tasks, key concepts, important topics, names and more.''' It allows for a quick overview of all relevant information items on a topic at a glance. It helps keeping track of important elements of a topic, and may support communication of information to other people, for example in meetings. A Mindmap can also be a good tool for a [[Glossary|brainstorming]] process, since it does not focus too much on the exact relationships between the visualised elements, but revolves around a more intuitive approach of arranging information.\n\nThe central topic is written into the center of the [[Glossary|visualisation]] (e.g. a whiteboard, with a digital tool, or a large horizontally arranged sheet of paper). '''This central topic can be see as a city center on a city map, and all relevant information items then are arranged around it like different districts of the city.''' The information items should focus on the most important terms and data, and omit any unncessary details. These elements may be connected to the central topic through lines, like streets, or branches, resulting in a web structure. '''Elements may be subordinate to other elements, indicating nestedness of the information.''' Colors, symbols and images may be used to further structure the differences and similaritiess between different areas of the map, and the length thickness of the connections may be varied to indicate the importance of connections.\n\n== Links & Further reading ==\n''Sources:''\n* [https:\/\/www.mindmapping.com\/de\/mind-map MindMapping.com - Was ist eine Mindmap?]]\n* Tony Buzan. 2006.

Search terms: 'Mixed Effects Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nMixed Effect Models were a continuation of Fisher's introduction of random factors into the Analysis of Variance. Fisher saw the necessity not only to focus on what we want to know in a statistical design, but also what information we likely want to minimize in terms of their impact on the results. Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as psychology, social science, physics, and ecology.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nMixed Effect Models are - mechanically speaking - one step further with regards to the combination of [[Regression Analysis|regression analysis]] and Analysis of Variance, as they can combine the strengths of both these approaches: '''Mixed Effects Models are able to incorporate both [[Data formats|categorical and\/or continuous]] independent variables'''. Since Mixed Effect Models were further developed into [[Generalized Linear Models|Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models]], they are also able to incorporate different distributions concerning the dependent variable. \n\nTypically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.\n\nOften, these models serve as a baseline for the whole scheme of analysis, and thus already help researchers to design and plan their whole data campaign. Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed. Basically, all sorts of quantitative data can inform Mixed Effect Models, and software applications such as R, Python and SARS offer broad arrays of analysis solutions, which are still continuously developed. Mixed Effect Models are not easy to learn, and they are often hard to tame. Within such advanced statistical analysis, experience is key, and practice is essential in order to become versatile in the application of (generalised) Mixed Effect Models. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''The biggest strength of Mixed Effect Models is how versatile they are.''' There is hardly any part of univariate statistics that can not be done by Mixed Effect Models, or to rephrase it, there is hardly any part of advanced statistics that - even if it can be made by other models - cannot be done ''better'' by Mixed Effect Models. They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many studies in medicine that investigate how a certain drug works on people to cure a disease. To this end, you want to know the effect the drug has on the prognosis of the patients. What you do not want to know is whether people are worse off if they are older, have a lack of exercise or an unhealthy diet. All these single effects do not matter for you, because it is well known that the prognosis often gets worse with higher age, and factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet choices. What you may want to know, is whether the drug works better or worse in people that have unhealthy diet choice, are older or lack regular exercise. These interaction can be meaningfully investigated by Mixed Effect Models. '''All positive factors' variance is minimised, while the effect of the drug as well as its interactions with the other factors can be tested.''' This makes Mixed Effect Models so powerful, as you can implement them in a way that allows to investigate quite complex hypotheses or questions.\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of Mixed Effect Models is the level of experience that is necessary to implement them in a meaningful way. Designing studies takes a lot of experience, and the current form of peer-review does often not allow to present the complex thinking that goes into the design of advanced studies (Paper BEF China design). There is hence a discrepancy in how people implement studies, and how other researchers can understand and emulate these approaches. Mixed Effect Models are also an example where textbook knowledge is not saturated yet, hence books are rather quickly outdated, and also often do not offer exhausting examples to real life problems researchers may face when designing studies. Medicine and psychology are offering growing resources to this end, since here the preregistration of studies due to the reproducibility crisis offers a glimpse in the design of scientific studies.\n\nThe lack of experience in how to design and conduct Mixed Effect Models-driven studies leads to the critical reality that more often than not, there are flaws in the application of the method. While this got gradually less bad over time, it is still a matter of debate whether every published study with these models does justice to the original idea. Especially around the millennium, there was almost a hype in some branches of science regarding how fancy Mixed Effect Models were considered, and not all applications were sound and necessary. Mixed Effect Models can also make the world more complicated than it is: sometimes a regression is just a regression is just a regression."],"35":["The lack of experience in how to design and conduct Mixed Effect Models-driven studies leads to the critical reality that more often than not, there are flaws in the application of the method.

Mixed Effect Models can also make the world more complicated than it is: sometimes a regression is just a regression is just a regression.\n\n==  Normativity ==\nMixed Effect Models are the gold standard when it comes to reducing complexities into constructs, for better or worse. All variables that go into a Mixed Effect Model are normative choices, and these choices matter deeply. First of all, many people struggle to decide which variables are about fixed variance, and which variables are relevant as random variance. Second, how are these variables constructed - are they continuous or categorical, and if the latter, what is the reasoning behind the category levels? Designing Mixed Effect Modell studies is thus definitely a part of advanced statistics, and this is even harder when it comes to integrating non-designed datasets into a Mixed Effect Model [[Glossary|framework]]. Care and experience are needed to evaluate sample sizes, variance across levels and variables. This brings us to the most crucial point: Model inspection.\n\n'''Mixed Effect Models are built on a litany of preconditions, most of which most researchers choose to conveniently ignore.''' In my experience, this is more often than not ok, because it does not matter. Mixed Effect Models are - bless the maximum likelihood estimation - very sturdy. It is hard to find a model that does not have some predictive or explanatory value, even if hardly any pre-conditions are met. Still, this does not mean that we should ignore these. In order to sleep safe and sound at night, I am almost obsessed with model inspection, checking variance across levels, looking at the residuals, and looking for gaps and flaws in the model's fit. We should be really conservative to this end, because by focusing on fixed and random variance, we potentiate things that could go wrong. As I said, more often than not, this is not the case, but I propose to be super conservative when it comes to your model outcome. In order to get there, we need yet another thing: Model simplification.\n\nMixed Effect Models lead the forefront of statistics, and this might be the reason why the implementation of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) as a parsimony-based evaluation criterion is more abundant here when compared to other statistical approaches. P-values fell widely out of fashion in many branches of science, as did the reporting of full models. Instead, model reduction based on information criteria approaches is on the rise, reporting parsimonious models that honour [[Why_statistics_matters#Occam.27s_razor | Occam's razor]]. Starting with the maximum model, these approaches reduce the model until it is the minimum adequate model - in other words, the model that is as simple as possible, but as complex as necessary. The AIC is about the equivalent of a p-value of 0.12, depending on the sample size, hence beware that the main question may be the difference from the null model. In other words, a model that is better from the Null model, but only just so based on the AIC, may not be significant because the p-value would be around 0.12. This links to the next point: Explanatory power.\n\nThere has been some sort of a revival of r<sup>2<\/sup> values lately, mainly based on the suggestion of r<sup>2<\/sup> values that can be utilised for Mixed Effect Models. I deeply reject these approaches. First of all, Mixed Effect Models are not about how much the model explains, but whether the results are meaningfully different from the null model. I can understand that in a cancer study I would want to know how much my model may help people, hence an occasional glance of the fitted value against the original values may do no harm. However, r<sup>2<\/sup> in Mixed Effect Models is - to me - a step into the bad old days when we evaluated the worth of a model because of its ability to explain variance. This led to a lot of feeble discussions, of which I only mention here the debate on how good a model needs to be in terms of these values to be not bad, and vice versa. This is obviously a problem, and such normative judgements are a reason why statistics have such a bad reputation. Second, people are starting again to actually report their models based on the r<sup>2<\/sup>  value, and even have their model selection not independent of the r<sup>2<\/sup> value. This is something that should be bygone, yet it is not. '''Beware of the r<sup>2<\/sup> value, it is only deceiving you in Mixed Effect Models.''' Third, r<sup>2<\/sup> values in Mixed Effect Models are deeply problematic because they cannot take the complexity of the random variance into account. Hence, r<sup>2<\/sup> values in Mixed Effect Models make us go back to the other good old days, when mean values were ruling the outcomes of science. Today, we are closer to an understanding where variance matters, and why would we embrace that. Ok, it comes with a longer learning curve, but I think that the good old reduction to the mean was nothing but mean.\n\nAnother very important point regarding Mixed Effect Models is that they - probably more than any statistical method - remark the point where experts in one method (say for example interviews) now needed to learn how to conduct interviews as a scientific method, but also needed to learn advanced statistics in the form of Mixed Effect Models. This creates a double burden, and while learning several methods can be good to embrace a more diverse understanding, it is also challenging, and highlights a new development. Today, statistical analysis are increasingly outsourced to experts, and I consider this to be a generally good development. In my own experience, it takes a few thousand hours to become versatile at Mixed Effect Models, and modern science is increasingly built on collaboration."],"36":["== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures. Methodology therefore actively contributes to the diverse crises in different branches of science that struggle to generate reproducible results, coherent designs or transferable knowledge. The main challenge in the hemisphere of model treatments (including comparison, reduction and simplification) are the diverse approaches available and the almost uncountable control measures and parameters. It would indeed take at least dozens of example to reach some sort of saturation in knowledge to to justice to any given dataset using univariate statistics alone. Still, there are approaches that are staples and that need to be applied under any given circumstances. In addition, the general tendency of any given form of model reduction is clear: Negotiating the point between complexity and simplicity. Occam's razor is thus at the heart of the overall philosophy of model reduction, and it will be up to any given analysis to honour this approach within a given analysis. Within this living document, we try to develop a learning curve to create an analytical framework that can aid an initial analysis of any given dataset within the hemisphere of univariate statistics.  \n\nRegarding vocabulary, we will understand model reduction always as some form of model simplification, making the latter term futile. Model comparison is thus a means to an end, because if you have a deductive approach i.e. clear and testable hypotheses, you compare the different models that represent these hypotheses. Model reduction is thus the ultimate and best term to describe the wider hemisphere that is Occam's razor in practise. We have a somewhat maximum model, which at its worst are all variables and maybe even their respective combinations. This maximum model has several problems. First of all, variables may be redundant, explain partly the same, and fall under the fallacy of multicollinearity. The second problem of a maximum model is that it is very difficult to interpret, because it may -depending on the dataset-contain a lot of variables and associated statistical results. Interpreting such results can be a challenge, and does not exactly help to come to pragmatic information that may inform decision or policy. Lastly, statistical analysis based on probabilities has a flawed if not altogether boring view on maximum models, since probabilities change with increasing model reduction. Hence maximum models are nothing but a starting point. These may be informed by previous knowledge, since clear hypotheses are usually already more specific than brute force approaches. \n\nThe most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.\n\nInstead, one should always inspect all data initially regarding the statistical distributions and prevalences. Concretely, one should check the datasets for outliers, extremely skewed distributions or larger gaps as well as other potentially problematic representations. All sorts of qualitative data needs to be checked for a sufficient sample size across all factor levels. Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations. Pearson correlation even do not demand a normal distribution, hence these can be thrown onto any given combination of continuous variables and allow for identifying which variables explain fairly similar information. The word \"fairly\" is once more hard to define. All variables that are higher collected than a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are definitely redundant. Anything between 0.7 and 0.9 is suspicious, and should ideally be also excluded, that is one of the two variables. Correlation coefficients below 0.7 may be redundant, yet this danger is clearly lower. A more integrated approach that has the benefit to be graphically appealing are ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables. based on the normal distribution, this analysis represents a form of dimension reduction, where the main variances of datasets are reduced to artificial axes or dimensions. The axis are orthogonally related, which means that they are maximally unrelated. Whatever information the first axis contains,  the second axis contains exactly not this information, and so on. This allows to filter large datasets with many variables into few artificial axis while maintaining much of the information. However, one needs to be careful since these artificial axis are not the real variables, but synthetic reductions. Still, the PCA has proven valuable to check for redundancies, also since these can be graphically represented. \n\nThe last way to check for redundancies within concrete models is the variance inflation factor. This measure allowed to check regression models for redundant predictors. If any of the values is above 5, or some argue above 10, then the respective variable needs to be excluded. Now if you want to keep this special variable, you have to identify other variables redundant with this one, and exclude these. Hence the VIF can guide you model constructions and is the ultimate safeguard to exclude all variables that are redundant. \n\nOnce you thus created models that contain non-redundant variables, the next question is how you reduce the model or models that you have based on your initial hypotheses. In the past, the usual way within probability based statistics was a subsequent reduction based on p-values. Within each step, the non-significant variable with the highest p-value would be excluded until only significant variables remain. This minimum adequate mode based on a subsequent reduction based on p-values still needs to be tested against the Null model. However, p-value driven model reductions are sometimes prone to errors. Defining different and clearly defined models before the analysis and then compare these models based on AIC values is clearly superior, and inflicts less bias. An information theoretical approach compares clearly specified models against the Null Model based on the AIC, and the value with the lowest AIC is considered to be the best. However, this model needs to be at least 2 lower than the second best model, otherwise these two models need to be averaged. This approach safeguards against statistical fishing, and can be soldiered a gold standard in deductive analysis."],"37":["== '''Starting to engage with model reduction - an initial approach''' ==\n\nThe diverse approaches of model reduction, model comparison and model simplification within univariate statistics are more or less stuck between deep dogmas of specific schools of thought and modes of conduct that are closer to alchemy as it lacks transparency, reproducibility and transferable procedures.

Source: own.]]\n'''[[Glossary|Storytelling]] has been a way for humankind to express, convey, form and make sense of their reality for thousands of years''' (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000; Webster & Mertova 2007). 'Storytelling' is defined as the distinct tonality, format and presentation in which a story is told. The term 'narrative' includes both: the story itself, with its dramaturgy, characters and plot, as well as the act of storytelling (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). However, the term 'narrative' has been used used predominantly as a synonym for 'story' in academia for decades (Barrett & Stauffer 2009).\n\n'''Psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the notion of 'narrative' as being one of two forms of distinct modes of thinking in 1984''' - the other being the 'logico-scientific' mode (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). While the latter is \"(...) more concerned with establishing universal truth conditions\" (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.9), the 'narrative' mode represents the broad human experience of reality. This distinction led to further investigation on the idea that 'narratives' are a central form of human learning about - and [[Glossary|sense-making]] of - the world. Scholars began to recognize the role of analyzing narratives in order to understand individual and societal experiences and the meanings that are attached to these. This led e.g. to the establishment of the field of narrative psychology.\n\n'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).\n\n== What the method does ==\n'''First, there is a distinction to be made:''' 'Narrative' can refer to a form of Science Communication, in which research findings are presented in a story format (as opposed to classical representation of data) but not extended through new insights. 'Narrative' can also be understood as a form of scientific inquiry, generating new knowledge during its application. This entry will focus on the latter understanding.\n\n'''Next, it should be noted that Narrative Research entails different approaches''', some of which are very similar to other forms of qualitative field research. In this Wiki entry, the distinctiveness of Narrative Research shall be accounted for, whereas the connectedness to other methods is mentioned where due.\n\nNarrative Research -  or 'Narrative Inquiry' - is shaped by and focussing on a conceptual understanding of 'narratives' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009, p.15). Here, 'narratives' are seen as a format of [[Glossary|communication]] that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. \"Communities, social groups, and subcultures tell stories with words and meanings that are specific to their experience and way of life. The lexicon of a social group constitutes its perspective on the world, and it is assumed that narrations preserve particular perspectives in a more genuine form\" (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, p.2). '''Narratives are therefore not merely forms of representing a chain of events, but a way of making sense of what is happening.''' Through the telling of a story, people link events in meaning. The elements that are conveyed in the story, and the way these are conveyed, indicates how the story-teller - and\/or their social surrounding - sees the world. They are a form of putting reality into cultural and individual perspective. Also, narratives are never final but change over time as new events arise and perspectives develop (Jovchelovitch & Bauer 2000, Webster & Mertova 2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006). \n\nNarrative Research is \"(...) the study of stories\" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus \"(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.\" (Moen 2006, p.56). The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014)."],"39":["[[File:ConceptGLM.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Generalized Linear Models]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | [[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]]''' || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Individual|Individual]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Past|Past]]''' || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:Present|Present]]''' || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are a family of models that are a generalization of [[Regression Analysis|ordinary linear regression]], thereby allowing for different statistical distributions to be implemented.\n\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:GLM.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Generalized Linear Models until 2020.''' Search terms: 'Generalized Linear Model' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\nBeing baffled by the restrictions of regressions that rely on the normal distribution, John Nelder and Robert Wedderburn developed Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the 1960s to encompass different statistical distributions. Just as Ronald Fisher, both worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station, seemingly a breeding ground not only in agriculture, but also for statisticians willing to push the envelope of statistics. Nelder and Wadderburn extended [https:\/\/www.probabilisticworld.com\/frequentist-bayesian-approaches-inferential-statistics\/ Frequentist] statistics beyond the normal distribution, thereby unlocking new spheres of knowledge that rely on distributions such as Poisson and Binomial. '''Nelder's and Wedderburn's work allowed for statistical analyses that were often much closer to real world datasets, and the array of distributions and the robustness and diversity of the approaches unlocked new worlds of data for statisticians.''' The insurance business, econometrics and ecology are only a few examples of disciplines that heavily rely on Generalized Linear Models. GLMs paved the road for even more complex models such as additive models and generalised [[Mixed Effect Models|mixed effect models]]. Today, Generalized Linear Models can be considered to be part of the standard repertoire of researchers with advanced knowledge in statistics.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nGeneralized Linear Models are statistical analyses, yet the dependencies of these models often translate into specific sampling designs that make these statistical approaches already a part of an inherent and often [[Glossary|deductive]] methodological approach. Such advanced designs are among the highest art of quantitative deductive research designs, yet Generalized Linear Models are used to initially check\/inspect data within inductive analysis as well. Generalized Linear Models calculate dependent variables that can consist of count data, binary data, and are also able to calculate data that represents proportions. '''Mechanically speaking, Generalized Linear Models are able to calculate relations between continuous variables where the dependent variable deviates from the normal distribution'''. The calculation of GLMs is possible with many common statistical software solutions such as R and SPSS. Generalized Linear Models thus represent a powerful means of calculation that can be seen as a necessary part of the toolbox of an advanced statistician.\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\n'''Generalized Linear Models allow powerful calculations in a messy and thus often not normally distributed world.''' Many datasets violate the assumption of the normal distribution, and this is where GLMs take over and clearly allow for an analysis of datasets that are often closer to dynamics found in the real world, particularly [[Experiments_and_Hypothesis_Testing#The_history_of_the_field_experiment | outside of designed studies]]. GLMs thus represented a breakthrough in the analysis of datasets that are skewed or imperfect, may it be because of the nature of the data itself, or because of imperfections and flaws in data sampling. \nIn addition to this, GLMs allow to investigate different and more precise questions compared to analyses built on the normal distribution. For instance, methodological designs that investigate the survival in the insurance business, or the diversity of plant or animal species, are often building on GLMs. In comparison, simple regression approaches are often not only flawed within regression schemes, but outright wrong. \n\nSince not all researchers build their analysis on a deep understanding of diverse statistical distributions, GLMs can also be seen as an educational means that enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of approaches, thus preventing wrong approaches from being utilised. A sound understanding of the most important GLM models can bridge to many other more advanced forms of statistical analysis, and safeguards analysts from compromises in statistical analysis that lead to ambiguous results at best.\n\nAnother advantage of GLMs is the diversity of evaluative criteria, which may help to understand specific problems within data distributions. For instance, presence\/absence variables are often riddled by prevalence, which is the proportion between presence values and absence values. Binomial GLMs are superior in inspecting the effects of a skewed prevelance, allowing for a sound tracking of thresholds within models that can have direct consequences. Examples for this can be found in medicine regarding the identification of precise interventions to save a patients life, where based on a specific threshhold for instance in oxygen in the blood an artificial Oxygen sources needs to be provides to support the breathing of the patient.\n\nRegarding count data, GLMs prove to be the better alternative to log-transformed regressions, not only in terms of robustness, but also regarding the statistical power of the analysis. Such models have become a staple in biodiversity research with the counting of species and the respective explanatory calculations. However, count models are not very abundantly used in econometrics. This is insofar surprising, as one would expect count models are most prevalent here, as much of economic dynamics is not only represented by count data, but much of economic data is actually count data, and follows a Poisson distribution. \n\n== Normativity ==\nTo date, there is a great diversity when it comes to the different ways how GLMs can be calculated, and more importantly, how their worth can be evaluated. In simple regression, the parameters that allow for an estimation of the quality of the model fit are rather clear. By comparison, GLMs depend on several parameters, not all of which are shared among the diverse statistical distributions that the calculations are built upon. More importantly, there is a great diversity between different disciplines regarding the norms of how these models are utilised. This makes comparisons between these models difficult, and often hampers a knowledge exchange between different knowledge domains. The diversity in calculations and evaluations is made worse by the associated diversity in terms and norms used in this context. GLMs are surely established within advanced statistics, yet more work will be necessary to approximate coherence until all disciplines are on the same page."],"40":["==4. Features and Properties==\nSome properties of Poisson distribution are:\n\n1. As seen in figure 2, if a quantity is Poisson Distributed with rate parameter, \u03bb, its average value is \u03bb.\n\n2. Variance of the distribution is also \u03bb, implying when \u03bb increases the width of the distribution goes as square root lambda \u221a\u03bb.\n\n3. A converse in Raikov\u2019s theorem says that if the sum of two independent random variables is Poisson distributed, then so are each of those two independent random variables Poisson distributed.\n\nConsider the example of radioactive decay for long-lived isotopes, in a radioactive sample containing a large number of nuclei, each of which has a tiny probability of decaying during some time interval, T. Let\u2019s say the rate of decay is 0.31 decay\/second and is monitored for 10 seconds. That gives us the \u03bb1 0.31 * 10 = 3.1 which means the probability equals,\n[[File:3 equation.PNG|center]]\nConsider another example where \u03bb2 is 2.7, the probability is\n[[File:4 equation.PNG|center]]\n\nTherefore,\n'''If we look at the total number k = k1 + k2 of a radioactive decay in a time T, the result is also a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 -> \u03bb = 3.1 + 2.7 = 5.8 : P(k, \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 )'''\n[[File:5 equation.PNG|center]]\n\n''If we have two independent Poisson-distributed variables, their sum is Poisson distributed too.''\n\n4. The skewness is measured by 1\/\u221a\u03bb\n\n5. Excess kurtosis is measured by 1\/\u03bb. See the difference between excess kurtosis and kurtosis [https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/excesskurtosis.asp here]. In a nutshell, excess kurtosis compares the kurtosis of the distribution with the kurtosis of a normal distribution and can therefore tell you if an (extreme) event is more or less likely in this case than if the distribution followed a normal distribution.\n\n6. Poisson Limit Theorem states that Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution, under certain conditions. When the value of n (number of trials) in a binomial distribution is large and the value of p (probability of success) is very small, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution i.e., n -> \u221e and \u03bb = np, rate parameter, \u03bb is defined as the number of trials, n, in binomial distribution multiplied by the probability of success, p.\n\n7. A Poisson distribution with a high mean \u03bb > 20 can be approximated as a normal distribution. However, as normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution, a continuity correction is necessary. It would exceed the scope to discuss in detail here what this correction is. In short, it adds or substracts 0.5 to the value in question to increase the accuracy of the estimation when using a continuous probability approach for something that has discrete probabilities.\nFor example, a factory with 45 accidents per year follows a Poisson distribution. A normal approximation would suggest that the probability of more than 50 accidents can be computed as follows:\n\nMean = \u03bb = \u03bc =45\n\nStandard deviation = \u2202 = \u221a\u03bb = 6.71 P(X>50.5) -> after continuity correction =\n[[File:6 equation.PNG|center]]\nusing Z score table, see more [https:\/\/builtin.com\/data-science\/how-to-use-a-z-table here].\n\n==5.

Ordination techniques rely strongly on a profound knowledge of the underlying data format of the respective dataset that is being analysed. Since ordination allow for both inductive and deductive analysis, they often pose a risk for beginners, who typically get confused by the diversity of approaches and the answers these analysis may provide. This conduction is often increased by the model parameters available to evaluate the results, since much of ordination techniques allows for neither probability based assumptions, let alone more advanced information based techniques. What is more, ordinations are often deeply entangled in disciplinary cultures, with some approaches such as factor analysis being almost exclusive to some disciplines, and other approaches such as principal component analysis being utilised in quite diverse ways within different disciplines. This makes norms and rules when and how to apply different techniques widely scattered and intertwined with disciplinary norms, while the same disciplines are widely ignorant about other approach from different disciplines. Here, we try to diver a diverse and reflected overview of the different techniques, and what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. This will necessary demand a certain simplification, and will in addition trigger controversy within certain branches of science, and these controversies are either rooted in partial knowledge or in experiential  identity. Unboxing the whole landscape of ordinations is also a struggle because these analysis are neither discrete nor always conclusive. Instead they pose starting points that often serve initial analysis, or alternatively enable analysis widely uncoupled from the vast landscape of univariate statistics. We need to acknowledge to this end that there is a vast difference between the diverse approaches not only in the underlying mathematics, yet also how these may be partly ignored. This is probably the hardest struggle that you can fin neither in textbooks nor in articles. The empirical reality is that many applications of ordinations violate much of the mathematical assumptions or rules, yet the patterns derived from these analyses are still helpful if not even valid. Mathematicians can choose to live in a world where much of ordination techniques is perfect in every way, yet the datasets the world gives to ordinations are simply not. Instead, we have to acknowledge that multivariate data is almost always messy, contains a high amount of noise, many redundancies, and even data errors. Safety comes in numbers. Ordinations are so powerful exactly because they can channel all these problems through the safety of the size of the data, and thus derive either initial analysis or even results that serve as endpoints. However, there is a difference between initial or final results, and this will be our first starting point here.\n\nOrdination are one of the pillars of pattern recognition, and therefore play an important role not only in many disciplines, but also in data science in general. The most fundamental differentiation in which analysis you should choose is rooted in the data format. The difference between continuous data and categorical or nominal data is the most fundamental devision that allows you to choose your analysis pathway. The next consideration you need to review is whether you see the ordination as a string point to inspect the data, or whether you are planning to use it as an endpoint or a discrete goal within your path of analysis. Ordinations re indeed great for skimming through data, yet can also serve as a revelation of results you might not get through other approaches. Other consideration regarding ordinations are related to deeper matters of data formats, especially the question of linearity of continuous variables. This already highlights the main problem of ordination techniques, namely that you need a decent overview in order to choose the most suitable analysis, because only through experience can you pick what serves your dataset best. This is associated to the reality that many analysis made with ordinations are indeed compromises. Ecology and psychology are two examples of disciplines why imagined ordinations deeply enough into the statistical designs to derive datasets where more often than not assumptions for statistical analysis of a respective ordination are met. However, many analyses based on ordinations are indeed compromises, and from a mathematical standpoint are real world analysis based on ordinations a graveyard of mathematical assumptions, and violation of analytical foundations that borderline ethical misconduct. In other words, much of ordinations are messy. This is especially true because ordinations are indeed revealing mostly continuous results in the form of location on ordination axes. While multivariate analyis based on cluster analysis are hence more discrete through the results being presented as groups, ordinations are typically nice to graphically inspect, but harder to analytical embedded into a wider framework. More on this point later. Let us now begin with a presentation of the diverse ordination types and their respective origins. \n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\nThis ordination is one of the most original ordination techniques, and builds form its underlying mechanics on the principal component analysis. However, since it is based on the chi square test, it is mainly applied for categorical data, although it can also be applied to count data, given that the dataset contains enough statistical power for this. In a nutshell, the correspondence analysis creates orthogonal axis that represent a dimension reduction of the input data, thereby effectively reducing the multivariate categorical data into artificial exes, out of which the first contains the most explanatory power. Typically, the second and third axis contain still meaningful information, yet for most datasets the first two axis may suffice. The correspondence analysis is today mostly negotiable in terms of its direct application, yet serves as an important basis for other approaches, such as the Detrended Correspondence analysis or the Canonical Correspondence analysis. This is also partly related to the largest flaw in the Correspondence analysis, namely the so called Arch-effect, where information on the first two axis is skewed due to mathematical representation of the data. Still, the underlying calculation, mainly the reciprocal averaging approach make it stand out as a powerful tool to sort large multivariate datasets based on categorical or count data. Consequently, the basic reciprocal averaging was initially very relevant for scientific disciplines such as ecology and psychology. \n\n=== Detrended Correspondence analysis ==="],"43":["<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.describe()## here you can an overview over the standard descriptive data.\n<\/syntaxhighlight> \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\ndata.columns #This command shows you the variables you will be able to use. The data type is object, since it contains different data formats.\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n==Homoscedasticity and Heteroscedasticity==\nBefore conducting a regression analysis, it is important to look at the variance of the residuals. In this case, the term \u2018residual\u2019 refers to the difference between observed and predicted data (Dheeraja V.2022).\n\nIf the variance of the residuals is equally distributed, it is called homoscedasticity. Unequal variance in residuals causes heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\nIf heteroscedasticity is the case, the OLS is not the most efficient estimating approach anymore. This does not mean that your results are biased, it only means that another approach can create a linear regression that more adequately models the actual trend in the data. In most cases, you can transform the data in a way that the OLS mechanics function again.\nTo find out if either homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity is the case, we can look at the data with the help of different visualization approaches.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"sex\") ## creates a pairplot with a matrix of each variable on the y- and x-axis, but gender, which is colored in orange (hue= \"sex\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored of the final written exam, exercise and number of solved questions among males and females (gender group).\n\nLooking a the graphs along the diagonal line, it shows a higher peak among the male students than the female students for the written exam, solved question (quanti) and exercise points (points). Looking at the relationship between exam and points, no clear pattern can be identified. Therefore, it cannot be safely assumed, that a heteroscedastic dispersion is given.\n[[File:Pic 1.png|700px]]\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nsns.pairplot(data, hue=\"group\", diag_kind=\"hist\")\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\nThe pair plot model shows the overall performance scored in the final written exam, for the exercises and number of solved questions solved among the learning groups A,B and C.\n\n[[File:Pic 2.png|700px]]\n\nThe histograms among the diagonal line from top left to bottom right show no normal distribution. The histogram for id can be ignored since it does not provide any information about the student records. Looking at the relationship between exam and points, a slight pattern could be identified that would hint to heteroscedastic dispersion.\n\n===Correlations with Heatmap===\nA heatmap shows the correlation between different variables. Along the diagonal line from left to right, there is perfect positive correlation because it is the correlation of one variable against itself. Generally, you can assess the heatmap fully visually, since the darker the square, the stronger the correlation.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\np=sns.heatmap(data.corr(),\n              annot=True, cmap='PuBu');\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:Pic 3.png]]\n\nThe results of the heatmap are quite surprising. There is no positive correlation between any activity prior to the exam and the exam points scored. In fact, a negative correlation between quanti and exam of -0.21 is considerably large. If this is confirmed in the OLS, one explanation could be that the students lacked time to study for the exam because of the number of exercises solved. The only positive, albeit not too strong correlation can be found between points and quanti. This positive relationship seems intuitive considering that with an increased number of exercises solved, the total of points that can be achieved increases and the students will generally have more total points.\n\n==OLS==\nNow, we will have a look at different OLS approaches. We will test for heteroscedasticity formally in each model with the Breusch-Pagan test.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nmodel_1 = smf.ols(formula='points ~ ID + quanti', data=data) ## defines the first model with points being the dependent and id and quanti being the independendet variable\nresult_bp1 = model_1.fit()\n\n# Checking for heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test\nbp1_test = het_breuschpagan(result_bp1.resid, result_bp1.model.exog)\n\n# Print the Breusch-Pagan test p-value\nprint(\"Breusch-Pagan test p-value:\", bp1_test[1])\n\n## If the p value is smaller then the set limit (e.g., 0.05, we need to reject the assumption of homoscedasticity and assume heteroscedasticity).\n\nresult = model_1.fit() ## estimates the regression\n\nprint(result.summary()) ## print the result\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:new_attempt.png]]\n\nLooking at the Breusch-Pagan test, we can see that we cannot reject the assumption of homoscedasticity. \nConsidering the correlation coefficients, no statistically significant relationship can be identified. The positive relationship between quanti and points can be found again, but it is not statistically significant.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfrom statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan\n\nmodel_2 = smf.ols(formula='points ~ ID + sex', data=data)\nresult_bp2 = model_2.fit()\n\n# Checking for heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan test\nbp2_test = het_breuschpagan(result_bp2.resid, result_bp2.model.exog)\n\n# Print the Breusch-Pagan test p-value\nprint(\"Breusch-Pagan test p-value:\", bp2_test[1])\n\n# Set the value for maxlags\nmaxlags = 25  # Update this value as needed\n\nresult = model_2.fit(cov_type='HAC', cov_kwds={'maxlags': maxlags})\nprint(result.summary())\n\n# Assuming 'sex' is a column in the DataFrame named 'data'\nsex_counts = data['sex'].value_counts()\n\n# Print the frequency table\nprint(sex_counts)\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:OLS 2.png]]\n\nBased on the Breusch-Pagan test, the assumption of homoscedasticity needs to be rejected to the 0.1% significance level. Therefore, we correct for heteroscedasticity with HAC (for more details see here)\nLooking at the results, being female (\"sex\") has a large negative effect on points and is highly statistically significant. However, looking at the number of females in the dataset, we need to be very cautious to draw any conclusions. Since there are only four females in the dataset (and 73 males), the sample size is considered too small to make any statements about gendered effects on total points achieved. The correlation between ID and points can be ignored, since the last number of the matricle numbers follow no pattern.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfrom statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan\n\nmodel_3 = smf.ols(formula='points ~ ID + exam', data=data)\nresult_bp2 = model_3.fit()"],"44":["[[File:ConceptVisualisationScenarioPlanning.png|450px|frameless|left|[[Sustainability Methods:About|Method categorization]] for [[Scenario Planning]]]]\n\n<br\/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 50%\"\n! colspan = 3 | Method categorization\n|-\n| '''[[:Category:Quantitative|Quantitative]]''' || colspan=\"2\" | '''[[:Category:Qualitative|Qualitative]]'''\n|-\n| [[:Category:Inductive|Inductive]] || colspan=\"2\"| '''[[:Category:Deductive|Deductive]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Individual|Individual]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| '''[[:Category:System|System]]''' || '''[[:Category:Global|Global]]'''\n|-\n| style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Past|Past]] || style=\"width: 33%\"| [[:Category:Present|Present]] || '''[[:Category:Future|Future]]'''\n|}\n<br\/>__NOTOC__\n<br\/><br\/>\n'''In short:''' Scenario Planning is a systematic designation of potential futures to enable long term strategic planning.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Scenario planning.png|400px|thumb|right|'''SCOPUS hits per year for Scenario Planning until 2019.'''

Source: own.]]\n\n'''The use of scenarios as a tool for structured thinking about the future dates back to the Manhattan Project in the early 1940s'''. The physicists involved in developing the atomic bomb attempted to estimate the consequences of its explosion and employed computer simulations to do so. Subsequently, this approach advanced in three separate strands: computer simulations, game theory, and military planning through, among others, the RAND corporation that also developed the [[Delphi]] Method. Later, during the 1960s, scenarios were \"(...) extensively used for social forecasting, public policy analysis and [[Glossary|decision making]]\" in the US. (Amer et al. 2013, p.24).\n\n'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.''' At the time, corporate planning was traditionally \"(...) based on forecasts, which worked reasonably well in the relatively stable 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, however, forecasting errors have become more frequent and occasionally of dramatic and unprecedented magnitude.\" (Wack 1985, p.73). As a response to this and to be prepared for potential market shocks, Shell introduced the \"Unified Planning Machinery\". The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982, more than 50% of Fortune 500 (= the 500 highest-grossing US companies) had switched to Scenario Planning (2). \n\nToday, Scenario Planning remains an important tool for corporate planning in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty in business environments (5). Adjacent to [[Visioning & Backcasting]], it has also found its way into research. For instance, researchers in [[Glossary|transdisciplinary]] sustainability science gather stakeholders' expertise to think about (un)desirable states of the future and how (not) to get there. This way, companies, non-governmental organizations, cities and even national states can be advised and supported in their planning.\n\n\n== What the method does ==\nScenario Planning is the systematic development of descriptions of (typically multiple) plausible futures, which are then called \"scenarios\". These descriptions of plausible futures may be illustrated with quantitative and precise details. However, the focus lies on presenting them \"(...) in coherent script-like or narrative fashion.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195). The scenarios developed in a Scenario Planning process are all \"fundamentally different\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.195) and may be contradictory and irreconcilable, but there is no inherent ranking between them (2). The core idea is not to present the most probable version of the future, but to get an idea about the range of possible developments of system variables and their interactions (2, 5). Scenarios \"(...) are not states of nature nor statistical predictions. The focus is not on single-line forecasting nor on fully estimating probability distributions, but rather on bounding and better understanding future uncertainties.\" (Schoemaker 1993, p.196).\n\n'''There is no ''one'' procedure for Scenario Planning''' (5). A commonly cited approach by Schoemaker (2, 3) includes the following steps:<br>\n1) Definition of time frame, scope, decision variables and major actors of the issue in question.\n\n2) Identification of current trends and predetermined elements and how they influence the defined decision variables, based on the knowledge of experts and the available data. It should be observed whether major trends are compatible with each other and which uncertainties exist. \n\n3) Construction of extreme future states along a specific continuum (positive vs negative, probable vs surprising, continuous vs divergent etc.) for all the elements or variables. These extremes are then assessed for their internal consistency and plausibility in terms of stakeholder decisions, trends and outcomes.\n\n4) Elimination of implausible or impossible futures and, based on the themes that emerged from these, the creation of new scenarios. This process is repeatedly done until internally consistent scenarios are found. The number of scenarios developed depends on the scope and purpose of the planning process (1, 5).\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Process.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Evaluation of the number of scenarios developed.''' Source: Amer et al. 2013. p.33]]\n\n5) The preliminary scenarios are analysed in terms of which decisions would need to be taken by the key stakeholders to reach them, and potentially revised again when further investigation of these scenarios brings up additional or contradictory knowledge about them. The scenarios may also be transferred into quantitative models to learn about the development and inherent uncertainties of individual variables.\n\n6) Finally, these preliminary scenarios are re-iterated by going through the previous steps again, checking for their applicability to the issue at hand, until finally, scenarios emerge that can be used for planning processes.\n\n[[File:Scenario Planning Example.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Exemplary scenarios for life in Australian cities.'''

Search terms: 'Social Network Analysis' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\n'''One of the originators of Network Analysis was German philosopher and sociologist Georg Simmel'''. His work around the year 1900 highlighted the importance of social relations when understanding social systems, rather than focusing on individual units. He argued \"against understanding society as a mass of individuals who each react independently to circumstances based on their individual tastes, proclivities, and beliefs and who create new circumstances only by the simple aggregation of their actions. (...) [W]e should focus instead on the emergent consequences of the interaction of individual actions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.6)\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis History Moreno.png|350px|thumb|left|'''Moreno's original work on Social Networks.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.892]]\n\nRomanian-American psychosociologist '''Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s''' with his - and his collaborator Helen Jennings' - 'sociometry', which served \"(...) as a way of conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction.\" (Scott 1988, p.110). Their work was sparked by a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York. Their assumption was that the girls ran away because of the position they occupated in their social networks (see Diagram).\n\nMoreno's and Jennings' work was subsequently taken up and furthered as the field of ''''group dynamics', which was highly relevant in the US in the 1950s and 1960s.''' Simultaneously, sociologists and anthropologists further developed the approach in Britain. \"The key element in both the American and the British research was a concern for the structural properties of networks of social relations, and the introduction of concepts to describe these properties.\" (Scott 1988, p.111). In the 1970s, Social Network Analysis gained even more traction through the increasing application in fields such as geography, economics and linguistics. Sociologists engaging with Social Network Analysis remained to come from different fields and topical backgrounds after that. Two major research areas today are community studies and interorganisational relations (Scott 1988; Borgatti et al. 2009). However, since Social Network Analysis allows to assess many kinds of complex interaction between entities, it has also come to use in fields such as ecology to identify and analyze trophic networks, in computer science, as well as in epidemiology (Stattner & Vidot 2011, p.8).\n\n\n== What the method does ==\n\"Social network analysis is neither a theory nor a methodology. Rather, it is a perspective or a paradigm.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.17) It subsumes a broad variety of methodological approaches; the fundamental ideas will be presented hereinafter.\n\nSocial Network Analysis is based on the idea that \"(...) social life is created primarily and most importantly by relations and the patterns formed by these relations. '''Social networks are formally defined as a set of nodes (or network members) that are tied by one or more types of relations.\"''' (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.1; Scott 1988). These network members are also commonly referred to as \"entitites\", \"actors\", \"vertices\" or \"agents\" and are most commonly persons or organizations, but can in theory be anything (Marin & Wellman 2010). The nodes are \"(...) tied to one another through socially meaningful relations\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503), which can be \"(...) collaborations, friendships, trade ties, web links, citations, resource flows, information flows (...) or any other possible connection\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.2). It is important to acknowledge that each node can have different relations to all other nodes, spheres and levels of the network. Borgatti et al. (2009) refer to four types of relations in general: similarities, social relations, interactions, and flows.\n\n[[File:Social Network Analysis Type of Ties.png|800px|thumb|center|'''Types of Ties in a Social Network.''' Source: Borgatti et al. 2009, p.894]]\n\nThe Social Network Analyst then analyzes these relations \"(...) for structural patterns that emerge among these actors. Thus, an analyst of social networks looks beyond attributes of individuals to also examine the relations among actors, how actors are positioned within a network, and how relations are structured into overall network patterns.\" (Prell et al. 2009, p.503). '''Social Network Analysis is thus not the study of relations between individual pairs of nodes, which are referred to as \"dyads\", but rather the study of patterns within a network.''' The broader context of each connection is of relevance, and interactions are not seen independently but as influenced by the adjacent network surrounding the interaction. This is an important underlying assumption of Social Network Theory: the behavior of similar actors is based not primarily on independently shared characteristics between different actors within a network, but rather merely correlates with these attributes. Instead, it is assumed that the actors' behavior emerges from the interaction between them: \"Their similar outcomes are caused by the constraints, opportunities, and perceptions created by these similar network positions.\" (Marin & Wellman 2010, p.3). Surrounding actors may provide leverage or influence that affect the agent's actions (Borgatti et al. 2009)"],"46":["'''Note:''' This entry revolves specifically around Stacked Area plots. For more general information on quantitative data visualisation, please refer to [[Introduction to statistical figures]].\n\n'''In short:''' \nThis entry aims to introduce Stacked Area Plot and its visualization using R\u2019s <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot2<\/syntaxhighlight> package. A Stacked Area Plot is similar to an Area Plot with the difference that it uses multiple data series. And an Area Plot is similar to a Line Plot with the difference that the area under the line is colored.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA Stacked Area Plot displays quantitative values for multiple data series. The plot comprises of lines with the area below the lines colored (or filled) to represent the quantitative value for each data series. \nThe Stacked Area Plot displays the evolution of a numeric variable for several groups of a dataset. Each group is displayed on top of each other, making it easy to read the evolution of the total.\nA Stacked Area Plot is used to track the total value of the data series and also to understand the breakdown of that total into the different data series. Comparing the heights of each data series allows us to get a general idea of how each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the total.\nA data series is a set of data represented as a line in a Stacked Area Plot.\n\n==Best practices==\n\nLimit the number of data series. The more data series presented, the more the color combinations are used.\n\nConsider the order of the lines. While the total shape of the plot will be the same regardless of the order of the data series lines, reading the plot can be supported through a good choice of line order.\n\n==Some issues with stacking==\n\nStacked Area Plots must be applied carefully since they have some limitations. They are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series.\n\nTo have a clearer understanding, let us plot an example of a Stacked Area Plot in R.\n\n==Plotting in R==\n\nR uses the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> to create Stacked Area Plots.\nThe function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> has the following syntax:\n\n'''Syntax''': <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot(Data, aes(x=x_variable, y=y_variable, fill=group_variable)) + geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nParameters:\n\n* Data: This parameter contains whole dataset (with the different data series) which are used in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* x: This parameter contains numerical value of variable for x axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* y: This parameter contains numerical value of variables for y axis in Stacked Area Plot.\n\n* fill: This parameter contains group column of Data which is mainly used for analyses in Stacked Area Plot.\n\nNow, we will plot the Stacked Area Plot in R. We will need the following R packages:\n[[File:stckarea.png|450px|thumb|right|Fig.1: An example of the stacked area plot.]]\n[[File:stcharea.png|450px|thumb|right|Fig.2: Stacked area plot after customization.]]  \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\nlibrary(tidyverse)  #This package contains the ggplot2 needed to apply the function geom_area()\nlibrary(gcookbook)  #This package contains the dataset for the exercise\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nPlotting the dataset <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>\"uspopage\"<\/syntaxhighlight> using the function <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>geom_area()<\/syntaxhighlight> from the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" inline>ggplot2 package<\/syntaxhighlight>:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"R\" line>\n#Fig.1\nggplot(uspopage, aes(x = Year , y = Thousands, fill = AgeGroup)) +\n  geom_area()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\nFrom this Stacked Area Plot, we can visualize the evolution of the US population throughout the years, with all the age groups growing steadily with time, especially the population higher than 64 years old.\n\n==Additional==\nAdditionally, we can play with the format of the plot.

Search term: 'thought experiment' in Title, Abstract, Keywords. Source: own.]]\n\n'''The Thought Experiment may well be the oldest scientific method.''' The consideration of potential futures was a vital step when our distant ancestors emancipated themselves and became humans. Asking themselves the ''What if'' questions was a vital step in the dawn of humankind, and both in the West and the East many of the first thinkers are known to have engaged in Thought Experiments. Methodologically, Thought Experiments provide a link between the metaphysical - or philosophy - and the natural world - i.e. natural sciences. Ancient Greece as well as Buddhism and Hinduism are full of early examples of Thought Experiments. Aristoteles remains a first vital step in the West, and after a long but slow growth of the importance of the methods, he represents a bridge into the early [[History of Methods|enlightenment]]. Galileo and Newton are early examples of famous Thought Experiments that connect theoretical considerations with a systematic reflection of the natural world. This generation of more generalisable laws was more transgressed with the ''Origin of Species'' by Charles Darwin. This theory was initially one epic Thought Experiment, and although DNA initially confirmed it, the role of epigenetics was another step that proved rather problematic for Darwinism. Mach introduced the term \"Thought Experiment\", and Lichtenberg created a more systematic exploration of thought experiments. Many ethical Thought Experiments gained province in the 20st century, and Derek Parfit is a prominent example how these experiments are used to illustrate and argument cases and examples within ethics.\n\n== What the method does ==\nThought Experiments are the philosophical method that asks the \"What if\" questions in a systematic sense. Thought Experiments are typically designed in a way that should question our assumptions about the world. They are thus typically deeply normative, and can be transformative. Thought Experiments can unleash transformation knowledge in people since such experiments question the status quo of our understanding of the world. The word \"experiment\" is insofar slightly misleading, as the outcome of Thought Experiments is typically open. In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.  \n\nThe easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a \"What if\" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers of variations of this experiment exist (see Further Information), as it can teach much about choice, ethics, and responsibility. For instance, many people would change the train direction, but hardly anyone would push a person onto the track to derail the train. This would save the other five, and the outcome would be the same. However the difference between pushing a lever or pushing a person has deep psychological ramifications that resolve around guilt. This exemplifies that the Thought Experiment does not necessarily have a ''best'' outcome, as the outcome depends - in this example - on your moral choices. Some might argue that you should hurl yourself onto the track to stop the train, thereby not changing the countable outcome, but performing a deeply altruistic act that saves everybody else. Most people would probably be unable to do this. \n\n'''Such deeply normative Thought Experiments differ from Thought Experiments that resolve around the natural world.''' Dropping a feather and a stone from a high building is such an example, as this experiment is clearly not normative. We are all aware that the air would prevent the feather to fall as fast as the stone. What if we take the air now out of the experiment, and let both fall in a vacuum. Such a Thought Experiment is prominent in physics and exemplifies the great flexibility of this method. Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat was another example of the Thought Experiment, where quantum states and uncertainty are illustrated by a cat that is either dead or not, which depends on the decay of some radioactive element. Since radioactive decay rates are not continuous, but represent a sudden change, the cat could be dead or not. The cat is dead and not dead at the same time. Many argue that this is a paradox, and I would follow this assumption with the supporting argument that we basically look at two realities at the same time. This exemplifies again that our interpretation of this Thought Experiment can also be normative, since a definitive proof of my interpretation is very difficult. This is insofar relevant, as seemingly all Thought Experiments are still based on subjective realisations and inferences. \n\n[[File:Schr\u00f6dingers Cat.png|400px|thumb|left|'''Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.'''

There are multiple approaches to detecting and dealing with outliers in time series data. We will have a look at detecting outliers first: 1. Distribution-based outlier detection: This detection method relies on the assumption that the data follows a certain known distribution. Then all points outside this distribution are considered outliers. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 2. Distance-based outlier detection: This method computes the distance from one point to all other points. A point is considered \u201cclose\u201d to another point when the distance between them is below a set threshold. Then, a point is considered an outlier if the fraction of points deemed close to that point is below a threshold. (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018) 3. Local outlier factor (LOF): The local outlier factor (LOF) is a measure of how anomalous an object is within a dataset, based on the density of its local neighborhood. The LOF is computed by comparing the density of an object's neighborhood to the densities of the neighborhoods of its nearest neighbors. If the density of an object's neighborhood is significantly lower than the densities of its neighbors' neighborhoods, then it is considered an outlier (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n1. is best to use when you have an idea of the distribution of your data, ideally if the data is normally distributed. This is especially the case for very large datasets.\n\n2. Is best when you expect outliers spread across the distribution, but you don't know the distribution.\n\n3. Is best when you want to identify outliers in clusters or in varying densities because you compare the data points to their neighbors. To decide, you can assess the distribution visually. For a better overview of the different approaches to handling outliers in general, see [[Outlier_Detection_in_Python|here]].\nIn general, many outlier detection methods are available ready-to-use in numerous python packages. This is an example of using the local outlier factor from the package scikit-learn:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt ## imports the necessary packages for visualization.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor ## imports the function for the local outlier function \n\nlof = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=20, contamination=.03)## considers 20 neighboured data points and expects 3% of the data to be outliers (see contamination)\nprediction = lof.fit_predict(df['usage_kwh'].to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1))## transforms the electricity usage columns to a NumPy array (\"to_numpy()\") and reshapes it to a single column (\"reshape (-1, 1)\"), fit.predict then predicts the outliers (outlier if the prediction = -1)\ndf['outlier'] = prediction == -1 ## creates a new column in the initial dataframe called an outlier, with true or false, depending on whether it is an outlier or not\n\noutliers = df[df['outlier']] ## creates  a column where only outliers are selected\n\nplt.plot(df['usage_kwh']) ## plots the dataframe\nplt.scatter(x=outliers.index, y=outliers['usage_kwh'], color='tab:red', marker='x') ## creates a scatter plot with the outliers, marked with a red x\nplt.title('Outliers in the dataset (marked in red)') ## title of the plot\nplt.xlabel('Date') ## titlex axis\nplt.ylabel('Usage (KWh)')## title y axis\nplt.show()\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:outlier plot.png|700px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 7: Outlier in the chosen part of the dataset (marked with red cross)<\/small>\n\nIn this case, these are probably false-positive outliers. The dataset is already pretty clean and does likely not contain many outliers.\n\nThe imputation of missing values is the next challenge after detecting outliers. The naive solution to this problem is to replace a missing point with the mean of all points. While this approach will not skew the data distribution significantly, the imputed values might be far off from the actual value and make messy graphics. An alternative is applying regression models that use predictive models to estimate missing points.\n\nA combined approach to both detects and replaces outliers is the Kalman Filter, which predicts new points based on the previous points and estimates a noise measure for new points. Thus, when an anomaly is detected, it is replaced by the prediction from the model using historical data (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018).\n\n===Forecasting Time Series Data===\n\nForecasting time series data can be of tremendous value in information gain. Since this is a large topic, this article will only touch on one method for forecasting: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models, or ARIMA for short. It consists of three parts:\n\n* The autoregressive (AR) component, which models the autocorrelation of the time series\n* The integrated (I) component, which models the non-stationary bits of the time series\n* The moving average (MA) component, which models the noise or error in the time series.\n\nEach component requires an appropriate selection of parameters. Choosing the right parameters can yield a powerful model. However, finding good values of the parameters can be difficult and requires further complicated techniques.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"Python\" line>\nimport statsmodels.api as sm ## needed to employ ARIMA\n\n# Fit the model on all data except for the last day (last 96 measurements). Order refers to the order of the different processes. The three numbers refer to the order of autoregression, the order of integration, and the order of the moving average process, respectively. With this information, Python can correct these issues and therefore optimize the forecasting results. freq='15T' indicates that the data has been collected every 15 minutes. \nmodel = sm.tsa.ARIMA(df['usage_kwh'].iloc[:-96], order=(1, 0, 0), freq='15T')\nmodel_fit = model.fit() ## estimates the best model\n\n# Predict how the last day is going to be\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\nfull_df = pd.concat([\n    pd.DataFrame({'value': forecast, 'name': 'forecast'}),\n    pd.DataFrame({'value': df['usage_kwh'].iloc[-192:], 'name': 'existing'})## -192 to get the data for the last two days\n])\n\npx.line(full_df, y='value', color='name',\n        title='Last day of electricity usage with prediction of the next 24 hours',\n        labels={'index': 'Date', 'value': 'Usage (KWh)'}) ##produce plot\n<\/syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[File:forecast plot.png|900px|center|]]\n<small>Figure 8: Forecast of the last day of the dataset compared to the actual values<\/small>\n\nARIMA models struggle with seasonality and often predict the mean of a highly seasonal time series a few steps ahead, just like in this example. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models take into account seasonality and are thus more suited for datasets that exhibit a strong seasonality (Hoogendoorn & Funk 2018). This would then be the next step to use another model, but this more simple example should suffice to show how forecasting with time series data generally works."],"49":["(4) Stein, E. D., White, B.
