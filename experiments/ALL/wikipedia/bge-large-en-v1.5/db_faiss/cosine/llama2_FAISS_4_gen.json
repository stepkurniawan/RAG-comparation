Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.\n\nHistory \nAlthough work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B.

In this way, the toxins are\u00a0concentrated upward\u00a0within ocean\u00a0food chains.\n\nWhen pesticides are incorporated into the\u00a0marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine\u00a0food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web.\n\nToxic metals\u00a0can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life.

There wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface.  After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called \"guyots\" or \"tablemounts\".\n\nSeamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.\n\nMost seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted","type":"Document"}]}}
