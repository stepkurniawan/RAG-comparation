Another advantage of linear regression is that the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\n\nLinear regression has many practical uses.

A more precise way to describe the Pauli exclusion principle is to say that two of the same kind of fermions that are in the same quantum system (same atom, for example) cannot have the same quantum numbers.

For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and ask them questions. Then, we use their answers as the data.\n\nThe choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly influences the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake.

It is a tool to show the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system. There are different ways to do this. Better curve fitting usually needs more complex calculations. \n\nData modeling can be used without knowing about the underlying processes that have generated the data; in this case the model is an empirical model. Moreover, in modelling, knowledge of the probability distribution of the errors is not required. Regression analysis requires assumptions to be made regarding probability distribution of the errors. Statistical tests are made on the basis of these assumptions. In regression analysis the term \"model\" embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions.\n\nRegression can be used for prediction (including forecasting of time-series data), inference, hypothesis testing, and modeling of causal relationships. These uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied. Regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions cannot be verified to hold."],"36":["geometric modeller\". Proc.
