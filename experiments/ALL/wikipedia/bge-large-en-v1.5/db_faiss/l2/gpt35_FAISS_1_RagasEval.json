In contrast, heteroscedasticity occurs when the variability of data points is not consistent across different levels of the independent variable. \n\nIdentifying whether the data exhibits homoscedastic or heteroscedastic dispersion is crucial because it can impact the accuracy of statistical tests, such as regression analysis. If heteroscedasticity is present,","44":"Shell is known for its significant contribution to the advancement of Scenario Planning. In the early 1970s, Shell began using scenario planning as a strategic tool to anticipate and plan for potential future developments in the oil industry. They worked with Pierre Wack, a French economist, to develop this approach further. Shell's use of scenario planning helped them navigate through the oil crisis of the 1970s and make strategic decisions that positioned them well in the market. This successful application of scenario planning by Shell has since inspired many other organizations to adopt and adapt this strategic planning tool.","45":"I don't have specific information about the influence on Social Network Analysis in the 1930s.","46":"I don't know.","47":"The purpose of thought experiments is to explore and understand complex concepts or theories by imagining hypothetical scenarios and reasoning through them. Thought experiments help to clarify ideas, challenge assumptions, and uncover implications of certain beliefs or principles. They are used to stimulate critical thinking, test the logical consequences of different hypotheses, and gain insights that may not be easily observable in the real world.","48":"Temporal autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is a statistical term that refers to the correlation between observations of a time series at different time points. In simpler terms, it is the correlation of a variable with itself over different time lags. This concept is important in time series analysis as it helps to understand the patterns and relationships within the data over time.","49":"I don't have information on the specific methods employed by the Besatzfisch project to study the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems."},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.9381107348,"1":0.9436885048,"2":0.9865453836,"3":0.9768654658,"4":0.9156882285,"5":0.9814836523,"6":0.9931479213,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.9488462001,"12":0.9622700301,"13":0.94523998,"14":1.0,"15":0.9944009982,"16":0.9385985805,"17":0.9889805068,"18":0.9230440984,"19":1.0,"20":0.9812241341,"21":0.0,"22":0.9281229958,"23":0.9328842341,"24":0.0,"25":0.9032341474,"26":0.9620780259,"27":0.8920479837,"28":0.9671093708,"29":0.9922917246,"30":0.998233635,"31":1.0,"32":0.9999986762,"33":0.993484059,"34":0.0,"35":0.8458177109,"36":0.0,"37":0.9626294841,"38":0.8925190205,"39":0.9545848097,"40":0.9999870288,"41":0.0,"42":0.978554577,"43":0.9983865757,"44":0.8972450361,"45":0.0,"46":0.0,"47":0.9898743068,"48":1.0,"49":0.0},"faithfulness":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":1.0,"3":1.0,"4":1.0,"5":null,"6":1.0,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":0.75,"17":0.0,"18":0.8571428571,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":null,"22":null,"23":1.0,"24":null,"25":1.0,"26":0.0,"27":1.0,"28":0.4,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"31":1.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":null,"35":1.0,"36":null,"37":0.0,"38":1.0,"39":0.0,"40":1.0,"41":null,"42":1.0,"43":1.0,"44":0.0,"45":null,"46":null,"47":1.0,"48":1.0,"49":null},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"2":1.0,"3":1.0,"4":1.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.5,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":1.0,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":0.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"31":0.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":0.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"38":1.0,"39":1.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"43":1.0,"44":0.0,"45":1.0,"46":0.0,"47":1.0,"48":0.0,"49":0.0},"context_precision":{"0":0.0,"1":0.0,"2":0.9999999999,"3":0.0,"4":0.9999999999,"5":0.0,"6":0.9999999999,"7":0.0,"8":0.0,"9":0.0,"10":0.0,"11":0.0,"12":0.9999999999,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.0,"19":0.0,"20":0.9999999999,"21":0.0,"22":0.0,"23":0.9999999999,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":0.0,"27":0.0,"28":0.0,"29":0.9999999999,"30":0.9999999999,"31":0.9999999999,"32":0.9999999999,"33":0.9999999999,"34":0.0,"35":0.0,"36":0.9999999999,"37":0.0,"38":0.0,"39":0.0,"40":0.9999999999,"41":0.0,"42":0.0,"43":0.9999999999,"44":0.0,"45":0.9999999999,"46":0.0,"47":0.9999999999,"48":0.0,"49":0.0},"answer_correctness":{"0":0.727026003,"1":0.8271956077,"2":0.829828815,"3":0.4518869809,"4":0.8293719247,"5":0.5406358399,"6":0.7344753272,"7":0.1995623472,"8":0.2016177471,"9":0.1787877245,"10":0.2150890837,"11":0.5277886671,"12":0.8159635682,"13":0.6133758073,"14":0.2222696856,"15":0.7270121365,"16":0.8394372575,"17":0.4533285911,"18":0.4630152972,"19":0.4472879207,"20":0.8693831924,"21":0.2024501608,"22":0.6366539135,"23":0.8365443645,"24":0.2217679027,"25":0.7316642537,"26":0.6721615963,"27":0.5368081015,"28":0.4158070629,"29":0.8664611831,"30":0.4451627383,"31":0.836693312,"32":0.7290048153,"33":0.7053859447,"34":0.1864997779,"35":0.7756713401,"36":0.8661146728,"37":0.7936306495,"38":0.7775213501,"39":0.536679548,"40":0.7346674508,"41":0.1829338241,"42":0.4935374216,"43":0.8945226963,"44":0.812340511,"45":0.2096305776,"46":0.1823235189,"47":0.873046784,"48":0.7842594175,"49":0.2224598406}}
