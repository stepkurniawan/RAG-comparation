39,What are Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and what are their advantages and disadvantages?,"Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are statistical models developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to handle non-linear dynamics. These models can compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion and outperform linear models when predictors follow a non-linear pattern. However, this comes at the cost of potentially losing the ability to infer causality when explaining the modeled patterns.",['A generative model is a process for creating data that uses randomness.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nLearning\nStatistics']," Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are a generative model that uses a process for creating data that uses randomness, and is an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an an",0.9589647096135453,,1.0,0.0,0.6919021739760491

41,How does the Pomodoro technique work?,"The Pomodoro technique works by deciding on a task, setting a timer for 25 minutes for example, working on the task until the timer rings, taking a short break if fewer than four intervals have been completed, and taking a longer break after four intervals, then resetting the count and starting again.","['hand, and shifting.\n\nThe violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune”. This is called intonation. The musician will also learn vibrato. This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble. This is important in many styles of music to create mood.\n\nBesides plucking (pizzicato), there are many special effects. Some of them are glissando, portamento, and harmonics. There is also double stopping, chords, and scordatura tuning.\n\nThe violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands. When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits, but this was not always the case.

There are simple algorithms to calculate median, mean (statistics), standard deviation etc. from these tables.\n\nStatistical hypothesis testing is based on the assessment of differences and similarities between frequency distributions. This assessment involves measures of central tendency or averages, such as the mean and median, and measures of variability or statistical dispersion, such as the standard deviation or variance.\n\nA frequency distribution is said to be skewed when its mean and median are different. The kurtosis of a frequency distribution is the concentration of scores at the mean, or how peaked the distribution appears if depicted graphically—for example, in a histogram. If the distribution is more peaked than the normal distribution it is said to be leptokurtic; if less peaked it is said to be platykurtic.\n\nFrequency distributions are also used in frequency analysis to crack codes and refer to the relative frequency of letters in different languages.\n\nStatistics']","
