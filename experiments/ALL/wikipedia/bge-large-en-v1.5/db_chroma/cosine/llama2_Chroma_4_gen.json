It comes from the Greek oikos = house; logos = study. \n\nEcology is the study of ecosystems. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity, ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth's atmosphere.  Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists. \n\nTerrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus.\n\nThere are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agriculture, forestry, fisheries), city planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.\n\nPopulation ecology \n\nPopulation ecology measures the size of a population: all the living things from","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{},"page_content":"1999.

It is used in biology to contrast with research done in the laboratory.\n\nField research is defined as a qualitative method of data collection that aims to observe, interact and understand people while they are in a natural environment. For example, nature conservationists observe behavior of animals in their natural surroundings and the way they react to certain scenarios. In the same way, social scientists conducting field research may conduct interviews or observe people from a distance to understand how they behave in a social environment and how they react to situations around them.\n\nField research encompasses a diverse range of social research methods including direct observation, limited participation, analysis of documents and other information, informal interviews, surveys etc. Although field research is generally characterized as qualitative research, it often involves multiple aspects of quantitative research in it.\n\nField research typically begins in a specific setting although the end objective of the study is to observe and analyze the specific behavior of a subject in that setting.
