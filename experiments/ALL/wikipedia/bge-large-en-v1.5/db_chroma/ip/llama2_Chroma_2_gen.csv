What is temporal autocorrelation?,Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future., ,"[Document(page_content='question was to answer. Depending on the difficulty the program will schedule when the user will see the question again. \nMemory\nLearning Methods\nLearning'), Document(page_content=""Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, or S.M.A.R.T. is a system to watch computer hard disks to help stop the risk of failures. It does this by watching  of the hard disks to try and see when a failure might happen and where.\n\nBackground \nHard drive failures fall into two categories:\nPredictable failures''' happen over a longer time period. Examples for this is mechanical wear, or degradation of the surface of the storage device.Unpredictable failures happen suddenly, in an unforeseen manner. Examples for this is the failure of an electronic component, or sudden mechanical failure, perhaps because of bad handling.\n\nPredictable failures can be detected by certain monitoring devices. This is like a thermometer in a vehicle that can alert the driver to do something before serious damage occurs, for example because the engine is too hot.\n\nAbout 60% of all drive failures are caused by failing mechanics. Most mechanical failures result from gradual wear. An eventual failure may be catastrophic. Before complete"")]"
What methods did the Besatzfisch project employ to study the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems?,"The Besatzfisch project employed a variety of methods including measuring fish population dynamics, questioning anglers about economic implications, modeling decision-making processes, conducting participatory workshops, and developing social-ecological models."," 

Besatzfisch was a project that studied the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems. It was a field study that was done in the laboratory and in the field. Researches studied the genetic variation in the fish populations and the pattern of mortality in these populations.","[Document(page_content=""Ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations.  \n\nThis contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level.  \n\nResearch in ecological genetics is on traits  related to fitness, which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, defence against predators. \n\nResearch usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.\n\nHistory \nAlthough work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B. Ford (1901–1988) in the early 20th""), Document(page_content=""Ecology is the branch of biology that  studies the biota (living things), the environment, and their interactions. It comes from the Greek oikos = house; logos = study. \n\nEcology is the study of ecosystems. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity, ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth's atmosphere.  Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists. \n\nTerrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus.\n\nThere are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agriculture, forestry, fisheries), city planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.\n\nPopulation ecology \n\nPopulation ecology measures the size of a population: all the living things from"")]"
