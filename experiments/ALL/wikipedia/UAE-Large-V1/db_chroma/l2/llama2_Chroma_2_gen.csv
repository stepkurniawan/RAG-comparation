In a real-life experiment, people can see and measure changes, but thought experiments only show special ways of thinking.  Anyone can do a thought experiment.\n\nThe usual goal of a thought experiment is to show what might happen: if this were true, what would follow from it?\n\nThe history of science has many thought experiments in it. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to use the German term  (means 'thought experiment') in about 1812. \n\nPosing hypothetical questions had been done for long time (by scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of talking about it.\n\nFamous thought experiments\nTrolley problem\nSchrödinger's cat\n\nReferences\n\nRelated pages \nParadox\nZeno's paradoxes\n\nScience\nPhilosophy of science\nThought""), Document(page_content='An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Shapiro S.S. et al 2004.')]"

What methods did the Besatzfisch project employ to study the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems?,"The Besatzfisch project employed a variety of methods including measuring fish population dynamics, questioning anglers about economic implications, modeling decision-making processes, conducting participatory workshops, and developing social-ecological models.", The Besatzfisch project did not employ methods to study the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems. The project was a study on the effects of pesticides and toxic metals on marine life.,"[Document(page_content='fishermen, as well as spin and bait casting fishermen, to increase\xa0conservation\xa0and to protect rare fish such as marlin.
