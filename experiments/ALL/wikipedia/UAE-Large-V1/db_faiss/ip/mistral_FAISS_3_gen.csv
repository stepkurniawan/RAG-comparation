Genetic algorithms sometimes combine different approximation models to solve complex real life problems.\n Genetic algorithms do not scale well. That is, where the number of elements which are exposed to mutation is large there is often an exponential increase in search space size. This makes it extremely difficult to use the technique on problems such as designing an engine, a house or a plane. To use genetic algorithms with such problems,  they must be broken down into the simplest representation possible. For this reason, we see evolutionary algorithms encoding designs for fan blades instead of engines, building shapes instead of detailed construction plans, and airfoils instead of whole aircraft designs. The second problem of complexity is the issue of how to protect parts that have evolved to represent good solutions from further destructive mutation, particularly when their fitness assessment requires them')]"
What are the methods to identify redundancies in data for model reduction?,"The methods to identify redundancies in data for model reduction are through correlations, specifically Pearson correlation, and ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables."," In data analysis, redundancies can be identify using methods such as data compression, linear regression analysis, and normalisation.

How are 'narratives' used in Narrative Research?,"'Narratives' in Narrative Research are used as a form of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences.

Narratology is the study of narratives and the way events are presented in a sequence of written or spoken words. Narratives are the events that make up a story or book and the way the events connect to make up the plot.
