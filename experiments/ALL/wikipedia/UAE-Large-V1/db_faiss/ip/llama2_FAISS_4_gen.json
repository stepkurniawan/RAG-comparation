In a real-life experiment, people can see and measure changes, but thought experiments only show special ways of thinking.  Anyone can do a thought experiment.\n\nThe usual goal of a thought experiment is to show what might happen: if this were true, what would follow from it?\n\nThe history of science has many thought experiments in it. Hans Christian \u00d8rsted was the first to use the German term  (means 'thought experiment') in about 1812. \n\nPosing hypothetical questions had been done for long time (by scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of talking about it.\n\nFamous thought experiments\nTrolley problem\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat\n\nReferences\n\nRelated pages \nParadox\nZeno's paradoxes\n\nScience\nPhilosophy of science\nThought","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{},"page_content":"An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Shapiro S.S. et al 2004.","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{},"page_content":"the color blue than green\" could be a scientific hypothesis, though, because one could ask many people whether they like blue more than green and come up with an answer one way or the other.\n Design an experiment. If the hypothesis is truly scientific, it should be possible to design an experiment to test it. An experiment should be able to tell the scientist if the hypothesis is wrong; it may not tell him or her if the hypothesis is right. In the example above, an experiment might involve asking many people what their favorite colors are. Making an experiment can be very difficult though. What if the key question to ask people is not what colors they like, but what colors they hate? How many people need to be asked? Are there ways of asking the question that could change the result in ways that were not expected? These are all the types of questions that scientists have to ask, before they make an experiment and do it. Usually scientists want to test only one thing at a time.
