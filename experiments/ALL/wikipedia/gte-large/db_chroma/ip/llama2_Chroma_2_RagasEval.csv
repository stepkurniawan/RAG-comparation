The standard deviation of a sample is generally different from the standard deviation of its originating population. Because of that, we write  for population standard deviation, and  for sample standard deviation.

If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution, then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is normally distributed), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation.

Their work was based on a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York, assuming that the girls ran away because of their position in their social networks.","['Social psychology is the study in psychology of how people and groups interact. Researchers in this field are often either psychologists or sociologists. All social psychologists use both the individual and the group as their unit of analysis.\n\nDespite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate academic journals and professional groups. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II. Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.\n\nReferences\n\nRelating pages\nCognitive psychology\nErich Fromm\nSociology\n\nBranches of psychology'
 'A social network is a set of people who interact. This includes group organizations. The social relationships may include friendship/affect, communication, economic transactions, interactions, kinship, authority/hierarchy, trust, social support, diffusion, contagion, and so on. \n\nCalling social relationships a network calls attention to the pattern or structure of the set of relationships.\n\nA community social network is the pattern of relationships among a set of people and/or organizations in a community. Each of these networks can involve social support, give people a sense of community, and \nlead them to help and protect each other.\n\nHow big a personal network becomes depends on the individual and the type of relationships considered. The set of people that a person knows well or with whom a person frequently interacts seldom exceeds several hundred. As the size of a network grows, keeping relationships is strained by the size. There is a so-called ""Law of 150"" which suggests that about 150 people is the best size for a village or']"," The sociologists and psychologists who influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s include:

The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.\nIf the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram used by Nightingale.\n\nLimitations \n\nPie charts are not the most accurate way to show data: that has been known for some time.

 'An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Shapiro S.S. et al 2004.']", Thought Experiments are used to show what might happen if a theory is true.,0.9453234479954841,1.0,1.0,0.99999999995,0.7207431654055749
