Who influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s and what was their work based on?,"Romanian-American psychosociologist Jacob Moreno and his collaborator Helen Jennings heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s with their 'sociometry'.

The question is: What are the limitations of Stacked Area Plots?

The answer is: Stacked Area Plots are not the most accurate way to show data, and they are rare.

The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.\nIf the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram used by Nightingale.\n\nLimitations \n\nPie charts are not the most accurate way to show data: that has been known for some time.

If you had more heights for more years, you would plot years 4, 5 and so forth. When you had enough points on your graph, you could draw a line through each of the plotted points, making your graph a line graph. For example, the line graph at the upper right shows the unemployment rate (as a percent) on the vertical axis and the year (from 1950 to 2005) on the horizontal axis.\n\nLet\'s say you wanted a single graph showing both your height and your brother\'s height.

Someone verifying the counterexample may not think that it may be needed to change the color of these regions. This will make the counterexample look valid, even though it is not. \n\nPerhaps one effect underlying this common misconception is the fact that the color restriction is not transitive: a region only has to be colored differently from regions it touches directly, not regions touching regions that it touches. If this were the restriction, planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers of colors.\n\nOther false disproofs violate the assumptions of the theorem in unexpected ways, such as using a region that has multiple disconnected parts, or not allowing regions of the same color from touching at a'), Document(page_content='and Kaliningrad as part of Russia are not contiguous. Because the territory of a particular country must be the same color, four colors may not be enough.

This map then requires five colors, since the two A regions together are contiguous with four other regions, each of which is contiguous with all the others. If A had only three regions, six or more colors might be needed. In this way, it is possible to make maps that need an arbitrarily high number of colors. A similar construction also applies if a single color is used for all bodies of water, as is usual on real maps.\n\nAn easier to state version of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for')]"

Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body.

There are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically, and test their theories. Psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own; they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments; or they might do experiments on animals (which can be simpler and more ethical to study).\n\nPsychology shares other things with natural sciences, as well. For example, a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong. Just like in any natural science, a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one.
