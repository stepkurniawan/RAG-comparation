What is telemetry?,Telemetry is a method used in wildlife ecology that uses radio signals to gather information about an animal.,"
Telemetry is a technology that allows measurements to be taken from a distance and transmitted to a receiver for processing.

The measurements can be taken from a machine, a particle, or any system that can be represented by a signal.

The kurtosis of a frequency distribution is the concentration of scores at the mean, or how peaked the distribution appears if depicted graphically—for example, in a histogram.
