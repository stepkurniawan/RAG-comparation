Who influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s and what was their work based on?,"Romanian-American psychosociologist Jacob Moreno and his collaborator Helen Jennings heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s with their 'sociometry'. Their work was based on a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York, assuming that the girls ran away because of their position in their social networks."," The person who influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s was a sociologist by the 

Linton Clarke Freeman. He was one of the founders of the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis. In addition to founding modern quantitative genetics with his 1918 paper, he was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of gene frequencies among populations.

Bet betweenness centrality was first developed by Freeman. He was the founding editor of the journal Social Networks.

They also favor separate academic journals and professional groups.

What are the limitations of Stacked Area Plots?,Stacked Area Plots are not suitable for studying the evolution of individual data series.," Pie charts are not the most accurate way to show data, and they are rare in scientific writing. They are more common in business and economics. One reason for this may be that it is more difficult to compare the size of items in a chart when area is used instead of length.

The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.\nIf the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram used by Nightingale.\n\nLimitations \n\nPie charts are not the most accurate way to show data: that has been known for some time.

Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Shapiro S.S. et al 2004.'), Document(page_content='Thought is the operation of the brain in conscious activity.

There are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically, and test their theories. Psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own; they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments; or they might do experiments on animals (which can be simpler and more ethical to study).\n\nPsychology shares other things with natural sciences, as well. For example, a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong. Just like in any natural science, a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one.
