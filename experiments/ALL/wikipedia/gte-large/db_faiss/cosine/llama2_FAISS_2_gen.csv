What is the purpose of Thought Experiments?,"The purpose of Thought Experiments is to systematically ask ""What if"" questions, challenging our assumptions about the world and potentially transforming our understanding of it.", Thought Experiments are used to show what might happen if a theory is true.,"[Document(page_content=""A thought experiment is an experiment that takes place in people's minds instead of in a laboratory or in the real world. In a real-life experiment, people can see and measure changes, but thought experiments only show special ways of thinking.  Anyone can do a thought experiment.\n\nThe usual goal of a thought experiment is to show what might happen: if this were true, what would follow from it?\n\nThe history of science has many thought experiments in it. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to use the German term  (means 'thought experiment') in about 1812. \n\nPosing hypothetical questions had been done for long time (by scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of talking about it.\n\nFamous thought experiments\nTrolley problem\nSchrödinger's cat\n\nReferences\n\nRelated pages \nParadox\nZeno's paradoxes\n\nScience\nPhilosophy of science\nThought""), Document(page_content='An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.\n\nExperiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.<ref>Shapiro S.S. et al 2004.')]"
What is temporal autocorrelation?,Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future.,,"[Document(page_content='An autoregressive model is a kind of model, which is mainly used in statistics. Like all statistics models, the idea is to describe a random process. In an autoregressive model, the output value depends linearly on one of the previous values of the model, plus a ransom variable, which describes that there is some randomness in the outcome. \n\nStatistics'), Document(page_content='Time Series is a statistical method used to forecast revenues, hotel occupancy, interest rates etc.\n\nStatistics')]"
