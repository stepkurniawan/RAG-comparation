First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages,","provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and","'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==A\/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA\/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content.

The strength of the model can be approximated by the amount of explained variance, and the p-value indicates whether the different groups within the independent variables differ overall. One can however also test whether one groups differs from another groups, thus comparing all groups individually by means of a posthoc test (e.g. Tukey).\n\nWhen designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results.

At the heart of critical theory is the focus on critiquing and changing society as a whole, in contrast to only observing or explaining it. Originating in Marx, Critical Theory consists of a clear distancing from previous theories in philosophy - or associated with the social - that try to understand or explain. By embedding society in its historical context (Horkheimer) and by focussing on a continuous and interchanging critique (Benjamin) Critical Theory is a first and bold step towards a more holistic perspective in science. Remembering the Greeks and also some Eastern thinkers, one could"],"20":["2010, p.143). SST is defined by a systemic and iterative approach to understanding the world and acknowledges that social systems include diverse sets of worldviews and interests (9).

Generally, fixed effects are about what we want to find out, while random effects are about aspects which variance we explicitly want to ignore, or better, get rid of. However, it is our choice and part of our design whether a factor is random or fixed. Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables.

Hence, the variance of the agricultural fields is tamed by a higher number of replicates. This led to the ANOVA becoming one of the most relevant methods in statistics, yet recent developments such as the reproducibility crisis in psychology highlight that care needs to be taken to not overplay ones hand.

In other words, a substantial proportion of modern research cannot be reproduced. This crisis affects many arenas in sciences, among them psychology, medicine, and economics. While much can be said about the roots and reasons of this crisis, let us look at it from a statistical standpoint. First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased. Here, a preregistration of your design can help, which is often done now in psychology and medicine. Researchers submit their study design to an external platform before they conduct their study, thereby safeguarding from later manipulation. Much can be said to","a myth at best.

The reproducibility crisis in psychology is one example of these developments, yet all other disciplines building on statistics struggle to this end, too. Another problem is the fact that with this [[Questioning the status quo in methods|ever-increasing demand for \"scientific innovation\"]], models evolve, and it is hard to catch up.

Within normal science, these design criteria are what most scientists may agree upon to be central for the current debate and development about methods. Consequently, '''it is important to know these ''normal science'' design criteria also when engaging with sustainability science.'''

Pragmatically speaking, one could say that mindfulness practices are known to help people balance feelings of anxiety, stress and unhappiness. Many psychological challenges thus seem to show positive developments due to mindfulness practice. Traditionally, mindfulness is the seventh of the eight parts of the buddhist practice aiming to become free. \n\n== Getting started ==\nThe easiest form of mindfulness is to sit in an upright position, and to breathe in, and breathe out. Counting your breath and trying to breathe deeply and calmly is the most fundamental mindfulness exercises. As part of the noble eightfold path in Buddhism, mindfulness became a key practice in Eastern monastic cultures ranging across Asia. Zazen \u2013 sitting meditation \u2013 is a key approach in Zen Buddhism, whereas other schools of Buddhism have different approaches. Common approaches try to explore the origins of our thoughts and emotions, or our interconnectedness with other people.\n\n[[File:Headspace -","start by going on a walk by yourself in nature without any technical distractions \u2013 just observing what you can see, hear, or smell. Mindfulness is a practice you can implement in everyday activities like doing the dishes, cleaning, or eating a meal as well. The goal here is to stay in the present moment without seeking distractions or judging situations. Another common mindfulness practice is writing a gratitude journal, which can help you to become more aware of the things we can be grateful for in live. This practice has proven to increase the well being of many people, and is a good mindfulness approach for people that do not want to get into a mediation. Yoga, Tai Chi and other physical body exercises can have strong components of mindfulness as well. You will find that a regular mindfulness practice helps you relieve stress and fear, can increase feelings of peace and gratitude, and generally makes you feel more calm and focused.

Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets.

Ok, it comes with a longer learning curve, but I think that the good old reduction to the mean was nothing but mean.\n\nAnother very important point regarding Mixed Effect Models is that they - probably more than any statistical method - remark the point where experts in one method (say for example interviews) now needed to learn how to conduct interviews as a scientific method, but also needed to learn advanced statistics in the form of Mixed Effect Models. This creates a double burden, and while learning several methods can be good to embrace a more diverse understanding, it is also challenging, and highlights a new development.

They surpass the Analyis of Variance in terms of statistical power, eclipse Regressions by being better able to consider the complexities of real world datasets, and allow for a planning and understanding of random variance that brings science one step closer to acknowledge that there are things that we want to know, and things we do not want to know. \n\nTake the example of many","'''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.'''

Naturally, then, these models are the heart of the analysis, and depending on the discipline, the interpretation can range from widely established norms (e.g. in medicine) to pushing the envelope in those parts of science where it is still unclear which variance is being tamed, and which cannot be tamed.

As the number of dimensions increases, the distance between data points grows exponentially, making the data sparse and leading to difficulties in applying machine learning methods. This phenomenon requires gathering much more data for learning to occur effectively, making data visualization and interpretation harder, and increasing computational costs. Principle Component Analysis is a method that helps alleviate the curse of dimensionality by reducing the dimensionality of the data.","43":"It is important to determine heteroscedastic and homoscedastic dispersion in a dataset because it impacts the efficiency and accuracy of regression analysis. \n\n- **Homoscedasticity**: When the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) have a constant variance across all levels of the independent variables, it is called homoscedasticity. In this case, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is the most efficient and unbiased estimation method. \n\n- **Heteroscedasticity**: If the residuals have varying levels of variance across the independent variables, it is called heteroscedasticity. In the presence of","44":"Shell contributed to the advancement of Scenario Planning by introducing the \"Unified Planning Machinery\" in response to potential market shocks. This system enabled Shell to look ahead for six years initially and then expand their planning horizon until 2000. By using Scenario Planning, Shell's management was prepared to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises. The success of Shell's approach popularized Scenario Planning, leading to more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies adopting it by 1982.","45":"Romanian-American psychosociologist Jacob Moreno heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s with his work on 'sociometry', which focused on conceptualizing the structures of small groups produced through friendship patterns and informal interaction.","46":"The limitations of Stacked Area Plots include that they are appropriate to study the evolution of the whole data series and the relative proportions of each data series, but not to study the evolution of each individual data series. Additionally, stacking too many data series can lead to color combinations that are hard to interpret.","47":"The purpose of Thought Experiments is to explore modifications, manipulations, or completely new states of the world. They allow individuals to consider hypothetical scenarios, test assumptions, and reflect on different possibilities without the constraints of reality. Thought Experiments can help in understanding complex concepts, ethical dilemmas, and philosophical questions by engaging in speculative reasoning and open discourse.","48":"Temporal autocorrelation, also known as time series autocorrelation, measures the degree of similarity between a time series data and a lagged version of itself. It helps to understand how past data points in a time series are related to each other. High temporal autocorrelation indicates that there is a pattern or relationship between past and current data points in the time series.","49":"The Besatzfisch project employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to study the effects of stocking fish in natural ecosystems. They introduced fish into ecosystems and measured the subsequent population dynamics. Additionally, they collaborated with anglers to gather information on fish population sizes and economic implications. The project also involved analyzing the data using monetary models."},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.9935834753,"1":0.9507311015,"2":0.9865453836,"3":0.9971534637,"4":1.0,"5":0.9999984596,"6":0.9931479213,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":1.0,"10":0.9987377275,"11":0.9517957824,"12":0.962263969,"13":1.0,"14":0.969343266,"15":1.0,"16":0.8968225571,"17":0.9787293481,"18":0.9388465707,"19":1.0,"20":0.9948711199,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":0.9261359768,"24":0.9886850068,"25":0.9442990541,"26":0.9503817649,"27":0.8097466134,"28":0.9798164457,"29":0.9922293251,"30":0.9988224233,"31":1.0,"32":1.0,"33":0.9999992379,"34":1.0,"35":0.8759862703,"36":1.0,"37":0.9038804018,"38":0.9101109742,"39":0.9545848097,"40":0.9629559539,"41":0.9696848838,"42":0.9891024228,"43":0.9983865757,"44":0.9962839655,"45":0.9609576418,"46":1.0,"47":1.0,"48":0.9660124485,"49":0.9568721293},"faithfulness":{"0":null,"1":1.0,"2":null,"3":1.0,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":0.8333333333,"10":1.0,"11":0.8,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":0.6666666667,"18":0.4285714286,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.75,"26":1.0,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"31":1.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":1.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"38":1.0,"39":1.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"43":1.0,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":1.0,"48":1.0,"49":1.0},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"2":1.0,"3":1.0,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":0.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":1.0,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"31":1.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":1.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":0.5,"38":1.0,"39":1.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"43":1.0,"44":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":1.0,"48":0.0,"49":0.4},"context_precision":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"2":0.8333333333,"3":0.9999999999,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":0.8333333333,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.9999999999,"15":0.8333333333,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":0.9999999999,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":1.0,"26":0.8333333333,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":0.8333333333,"31":0.9999999999,"32":0.3333333333,"33":1.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.5833333333,"36":0.9999999999,"37":0.9999999999,"38":1.0,"39":0.9999999999,"40":1.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"43":1.0,"44":1.0,"45":0.8333333333,"46":0.8333333333,"47":1.0,"48":0.0,"49":1.0},"answer_correctness":{"0":0.8331338734,"1":0.4484484302,"2":0.980674676,"3":0.453172471,"4":0.6692824681,"5":0.7450678648,"6":0.8374118762,"7":0.9095223039,"8":0.4543173014,"9":0.5631081038,"10":0.6493108358,"11":0.4445280208,"12":0.659421832,"13":0.8824004579,"14":0.6175878257,"15":0.535442806,"16":0.7863446796,"17":0.7477349164,"18":0.5373166933,"19":0.4243297271,"20":0.4128877091,"21":0.6155692507,"22":0.7744519579,"23":0.7414871145,"24":0.8237471435,"25":0.7453105055,"26":0.5443115056,"27":0.7424435136,"28":0.7913927069,"29":0.8272657072,"30":0.6173647454,"31":0.8824754975,"32":0.5394257772,"33":0.8188568204,"34":1.0,"35":0.7403938982,"36":0.5764969048,"37":0.608937765,"38":0.7742656977,"39":0.5252403988,"40":0.9947555924,"41":0.8048222299,"42":0.5712900432,"43":0.9001477369,"44":0.7898913806,"45":0.5422601426,"46":0.8291467623,"47":0.8760334434,"48":0.2219827863,"49":0.8408331107}}
