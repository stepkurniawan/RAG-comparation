Equally, missing values need to be either replaced by averages or respective data lines be excluded. There is no rule of thumb on how to reduce a dataset riddled with missing values. Ideally, one should check the whole dataset and filter for redundancies. Redundant variables can be traded off to exclude variables that re redundant and contain more NAs, and keep the ones that have a similar explanatory power but less missing values. \n\nThe simplest approach to look for redundancies are correlations.

The distinctive feature of this approach - compared to other methods of qualitative research with individuals, such as [[Open Interview|Interviews]] or [[Ethnography]] - is the focus on narrative elements and their meaning. Researchers may focus on the 'narratology', i.e. the structure and grammar of a story; the 'narrative content', i.e. the themes and meanings conveyed through the story; and\/or the 'narrative context', which revolves around the effects of the story (Squire et al. 2014).\n\n'''One common approach in Narrative Research is the","type":"Document"}],"39":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{},"page_content":"than not characterised by non-linear patterns, which need us to step out of the world of linear dynamics.''' \n\nOver the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]].

Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features \/ dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases.
