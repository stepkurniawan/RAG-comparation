42,What is the 'curse of dimensionality'?,"The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning, including sparsity of data points, increased difficulty in learning, and complications in data visualization and interpretation.","[""curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features / dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases. '''Principle Component Analysis helps to alleviate this problem'''.\n[[File:""]",,0.9891077131042554,,1.0,0.9999999999,0.9183316560542214
