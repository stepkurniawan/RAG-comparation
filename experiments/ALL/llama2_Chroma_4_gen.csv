A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.\n\nAlthough procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methodologies of knowledge. Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses. These steps must be repeatable in order to dependably predict any future results. Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many hypotheses together in a coherent structure. This in turn may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context.\n\nAmong other facets shared by the'), Document(page_content='methods used by scientists to find knowledge.

They work at it, and collect facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully.\n Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do experiments and collect data.\n Eventually, they find what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it.\n Later, other scientists may agree or not agree.

In information theory, redundancy means that a message is encoded and transmitted using more bits that are necessary to encode the message.

Psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own; they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments; or they might do experiments on animals (which can be simpler and more ethical to study).\n\nPsychology shares other things with natural sciences, as well. For example, a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong. Just like in any natural science, a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one.
