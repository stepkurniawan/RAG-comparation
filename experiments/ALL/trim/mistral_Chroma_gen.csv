What is the advantage of A/B testing?,"The advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific, evidence-based process."," A/B testing allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version, reducing the potential for bias and collecting data over a period of time to provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.

==A/B Testing and its significance==
A/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented. This is important in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, and the treatment version is changed in","[Document(page_content=""provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and""), Document(page_content=""or Welch's t-test]] may be used to determine the significance of the treatment effect. However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https://data.library.virginia.edu/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate.\n\n==Advantages and Limitations of A/B Testing==\n'''Advantages'''\nA/B testing has several advantages over traditional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a product or design. First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages,""), Document(page_content=""'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==A/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content. This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific,"")]"

Within experimental settings, this can be quite demanding, which is why the ANOVA only allows to test very constructed settings of the world. All categories that are implemented as predictors in an ANOVA design represent a constructed worldview, which can be very robust, but is always a compromise. The ANOVA thus tries to approximate causality by creating more rigid designs. However, we have to acknowledge that experimental designs are always compromises, and more knowledge may become available later. Within clinical trials - most of which have an ANOVA design at their heart - great care is taken into account in terms of robustness and documentation, and clinical trial stages are built on increasing sample sizes to minimise the harm on humans in these experiments.\n\n'''Taken together, the ANOVA is one of the most relevant calculation tools to fuel the exponential growth that characterised the 20th century.''' Agricultural experiments and medical trials are widely built on the""), Document(page_content=""of variance]] (ANOVA), which unleashed the potential to conduct [[experiments]], starting in agricultural research, yet quickly finding its way into psychology, biology, medicine and many other areas in science. '''The ANOVA allows to compare several groups in terms of their mean values, and even to test for interaction between different independent variables.''' The strength of the model can be approximated by the amount of explained variance, and the p-value indicates whether the different groups within the independent variables differ overall. One can however also test whether one groups differs from another groups, thus comparing all groups individually by means of a posthoc test (e.g. Tukey).\n\nWhen designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results. Subsequently, ANOVA experiments became more complex, combining several independent variables and also allowing to correct for so called random factors, which are elements for which the variance is calculated out of the""), Document(page_content='therefore realize that a non-significant result might also be related to the factor level construction. Yet a potential flaw can also range beyond implausible results, since ANOVAs do not necessarily create valid knowledge. If the underlying theory is imperfect, then we might confirm a hypothesis that is overall wrong. Hence the strong benefit of the ANOVA - the systematic testing of hypothesis - may equally be also its weakest point, as science develops, and previous hypothesis might have been imperfect if not wrong. \n\nFurthermore, many researchers use the ANOVA today in an inductive sense. With more and more data becoming available, even from completely undersigned sampling sources, the ANOVA becomes the analysis of choice if the difference between different factor levels is investigated for a continuous variable. Due to the [[Glossary|emergence]] of big data, these applications could be seen critical, since no real hypothesis are being tested.
