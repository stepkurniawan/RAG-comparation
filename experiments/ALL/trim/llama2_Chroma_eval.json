If something can be tested, or finishes the tests correctly, it is testable. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines a test as: \"a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something\".\n\nA test is different from an experiment: Before a test is done, there is an expected result. The test is performed, to show this result. In an experiment, the outcome is open. Very often, tests are performed as part of an experiment.\n\nProducts \nProducts are usually tested for quality, so customers will get good products.\n\nIn software engineering, a test is used to see if the software system can do what it should. Software is tested before it is released. Alpha testing is where software developers check the software for bugs. Software can also be checked for quality and usability. Beta testing is done by groups of users.\n\nTests of cars and",

The car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail, or deliberately crashed to measure the damage. Other machines can also be crash tested. Crash test dummies can be used instead of humans. They are placed in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed.\n\nPeople \n\nPeople are tested to see what they have learned. This is often called an assessment or examination. In learning, a test item is a question, or set of questions.\n\nMany people think tests are valuable. They believe tests:\n are a quick and fair way of judging a test taker's performance\n enable predictions about test takers to be made\n allow selection\n improve performance by highlighting areas that need work.\n\nHowever, academic tests are not perfect measures.

They want to decide if the mean in group A is different to the theoretical value or to the mean in group B.\n\nExample\nFor example, pretend there are two groups of people. One group exercises a lot and the other doesn't. Do the people who exercise tend to live longer than those who don't? Then the property of interest is the average life time. Is the average life time of people who exercise different to the average life time of people who don't?

Testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those who are given a placebo.\n\nMethods \nMost often, we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments. For example, an opinion poll is one kind of survey. We pick a small number of people and ask them questions. Then, we use their answers as the data.\n\nThe choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly influences the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far-away and hard-to-reach spot of the lake.\n\nThere are two kinds of problems which are",
