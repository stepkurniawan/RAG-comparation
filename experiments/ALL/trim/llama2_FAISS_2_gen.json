It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate. Since ANCOVA is hypothesis-based test, we need to have a understanding and well developed question about our data that we want an answer to, before we can generate a hypothesis and run the test.\n\n\n===Data preparation===\nIn order to demonstrate One-way ANCOVA test we will refer to balanced dataset \"anxiety\" taken",
