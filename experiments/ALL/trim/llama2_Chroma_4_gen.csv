What are the key principles and assumptions of ANCOVA?,"ANCOVA compares group means while controlling for covariate influence, uses hypothesis testing, and considers Sum of Squares. Assumptions from linear regression and ANOVA should be met, which is normal distribution of the dataset."," ANCOVA is a statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the ""noise"" caused by a covariate variable that is not of experimental interest. The key principles and assumptions of ANCOVA are:

1. Linearity assumption: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.
2. homogeneity of variance assumption: The variance between groups must be homogeneous.
3. Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.

ANCOVA also has specific assumptions, One of them is homogeneity of slopes","[Document(page_content='==\n\'\'\'Regression assumptions\'\'\'  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for each treatment group.\n\'\'\'ANOVA assumptions\'\'\'\n# Variances between groups are homogeneous.\n# Residuals are randomly and normally distributed.\n\'\'\'Specific ANCOVA assumptions\'\'\'\n# A further specific (but optional) assumption is homogeneity of slopes. It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate.
