In regression analysis the term \"model\" embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions.\n\nRegression can be used for prediction (including forecasting of time-series data), inference, hypothesis testing, and modeling of causal relationships. These uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied. Regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions cannot be verified to hold.","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{},"page_content":"Informatica, 30:3\u201331, 2006.\n\nFurther reading \n\n Bradley, R.A. and Terry, M.E.

Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed.
