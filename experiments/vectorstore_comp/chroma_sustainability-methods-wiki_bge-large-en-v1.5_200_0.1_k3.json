Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent opposite ends of the spectrum, with frequentist methods requiring specific conditions like sample size and a normal distribution, while Bayesian methods work with existing data.","3":"Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging in the contexts of agency because lucky or unlucky actions that were not anticipated by the agents are not included in the definition of agency.","4":"For datasets containing only categorical data, users are advised to conduct a Chi Square Test. This test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between two categorical variables in the dataset.","5":"A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) is a versatile family of models that extends ordinary linear regressions and is used to model relationships between variables.","6":"Cluster Analysis is a approach of grouping data points based on similarity to create a structure. It can be supervised (Classification) or unsupervised (Clustering).","7":"Network Analysis is conducted to understand connections and distances between data points by arranging data in a network structure.","8":"ANCOVA is used to compare group means while controlling for the effect of a covariate.","9":"ANCOVA compares group means while controlling for covariate influence, uses hypothesis testing, and considers Sum of Squares. Assumptions from linear regression and ANOVA should be met, which is normal distribution of the dataset.","10":"ANCOVA assumptions include linearity, homogeneity of variances, normal distribution of residuals, and optionally, homogeneity of slopes.","11":"Strengths of Content Analysis include its ability to counteract biases and allow researchers to apply their own social-scientific constructs. Challenges include potential biases in the sampling process, development of the coding scheme, and interpretation of data, as well as the inability to generalize theories and hypotheses beyond the data in qualitative analysis of smaller samples.","12":"The three main methods to calculate the correlation coefficient are Pearson's, Spearman's rank, and Kendall's rank. Pearson's is the most popular and is sensitive to linear relationships with continuous data. Spearman's and Kendall's are non-parametric methods based on ranks, sensitive to non-linear relationships, and measure the monotonic association. Spearman's calculates the rank order of the variables' values, while Kendall's computes the degree of similarity between two sets of ranks.","13":"A correlogram is used to visualize correlation coefficients for multiple variables, allowing for quick determination of relationships, their strength, and direction. It is created using the R package corrplot. Correlation coefficients can be calculated and stored in a variable before creating the plot for clearer code.","14":"Telemetry is a method used in wildlife ecology that uses radio signals to gather information about an animal.","15":"A common reason for deviation from the normal distribution is human actions, which have caused changes in patterns such as weight distribution.","16":"The Shapiro-Wilk test can be used to check for normal distribution in data. If the test results are insignificant (p-value > 0.05), it can be assumed that the data is normally distributed.","17":"The Delphi method is chosen over traditional forecasting methods due to a lack of empirical data or theoretical foundations to approach a problem. It's also chosen when the collective judgment of experts is beneficial to problem-solving.","18":"The main goal of Sustainability Science is to develop practical and contexts-sensitive solutions to existent problems through cooperative research with societal actors. The challenges it faces include the need for more work to solve problems and create solutions, the importance of how solutions and knowledge are created, the necessity for society and science to work together, and the challenge of building an educational system that is reflexive and interconnected.","19":"Critical theory and ethics are important in modern science because it is flawed with a singular worldview, built on oppression and inequalities, and often lacks the necessary link between empirical and ethical consequences.","20":"System thinking is a method of investigation that considers interactions and interdependencies within a system, which could be anything from a business to a population of wasps.","21":"The main principle of the Feynman Method is that explaining a topic to someone is the best way to learn it.","22":"Fixed effects are the focus of the study, while random effects are aspects we want to ignore. In medical trials, whether someone smokes is usually a random factor, unless the study is specifically about smoking. Factors in a block design are typically random, while variables related to our hypothesis are fixed.","23":"The replication crisis refers to the inability to reproduce a substantial proportion of modern research, affecting fields like psychology, medicine, and economics. This is due to statistical issues such as the arbitrary significance threshold of p=0.05, flaws in the connection between theory and methodological design, and the increasing complexity of statistical models.","24":"The flashlight method is used to get an immediate understanding of where group members stand on a specific question or topic, or how they feel at a particular moment. It is initiated by a team leader or member, and involves everyone sharing a short statement of their opinion. Only questions for clarification are allowed during the round, and any arising issues are discussed afterwards.","25":"Generalized Linear Models can handle and calculate dependent variables that can be count data, binary data, or proportions.","26":"A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where numerical values are replaced with colors. It is useful for understanding data as it allows for easy comparison of values and their distribution.","27":"Alhazen contributed to the development of scientific methods by being the first to systematically manipulate experimental conditions, paving the way for the scientific method.","28":"Multivariate data can be graphically represented through ordination plots, cluster diagrams, and network plots. Ordination plots can include various approaches like decorana plots, principal component analysis plots, or results from non-metric dimensional scaling. Cluster diagrams show the grouping of data and are useful for displaying hierarchical structures. Network plots illustrate interactions between different parts of the data.","29":"Machine Learning can handle scenarios where inputs are noisy or outputs vary, which is not feasible with traditional rules or functions.","30":"Some of the challenges faced by machine learning techniques include a lack of interpretability and explainability, a reproducibility crisis, and the need for large datasets and significant computational resources.","31":"Scientific methods are reproducible, learnable, and documentable. They help in gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data. They can be differentiated into different schools of thinking and have finer differentiations or specifications.","32":"The main goal of practicing mindfulness is to clear the mind and focus on the present moment, free from normative assumptions.","33":"In a Mindmap, the central topic is placed in the center of the visualization, with all relevant information arranged around it. The information should focus on key terms and data, omitting unnecessary details. Elements can be connected to the central topic through lines or branches, creating a web structure. Colors, symbols, and images can be used to further structure the map, and the thickness of the connections can vary to indicate importance.","34":"Charles Roy Henderson developed the calculations that allowed for linear unbiased estimates in Mixed Effect Models.","35":"Mixed Effect Models surpass Analysis of Variance in terms of statistical power and eclipse Regressions by being better able to handle the complexities of real world datasets.","36":"Stepwise procedures in model reduction should be avoided because they are not smart but brute force approaches based on statistical evaluations, and they do not include any experience or preconceived knowledge. They are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way.","37":"The methods to identify redundancies in data for model reduction are through correlations, specifically Pearson correlation, and ordinations, with principal component analysis being the main tool for continuous variables.","38":"'Narratives' in Narrative Research are used as a form of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. They are not just representations of events, but a way of making sense of the world, linking events in meaning. They reflect the perspectives of the storyteller and their social contexts, and are subject to change over time as new events occur and perspectives evolve.","39":"Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are statistical models developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to handle non-linear dynamics. These models can compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion and outperform linear models when predictors follow a non-linear pattern. However, this comes at the cost of potentially losing the ability to infer causality when explaining the modeled patterns.","40":"Poisson Distribution can be used when 1. Data is counts of events i.e., they are non-negative integers. 2. The events are random and occur independently of each other. 3. The mean number of events occurring in a specific time frame is constant and known.","41":"The Pomodoro technique works by deciding on a task, setting a timer for 25 minutes, working on the task until the timer rings, taking a short break if fewer than four intervals have been completed, and taking a longer break after four intervals, then resetting the count and starting again.","42":"The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning, including sparsity of data points, increased difficulty in learning, and complications in data visualization and interpretation.","43":"Determining heteroscedastic and homoscedastic dispersion is important because the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) is only suitable when homoscedasticity is present.","44":"Shell significantly advanced Scenario Planning by introducing the \"Unified Planning Machinery\" in response to increasing forecasting errors. This system allowed them to anticipate future events and manage the 1973 and 1981 oil crises. Shell's success with this method led to its widespread adoption, with over half of the Fortune 500 companies using Scenario Planning by 1982.","45":"Romanian-American psychosociologist Jacob Moreno and his collaborator Helen Jennings heavily influenced the field of Social Network Analysis in the 1930s with their 'sociometry'. Their work was based on a case of runaways in the Hudson School for Girls in New York, assuming that the girls ran away because of their position in their social networks.","46":"Stacked Area Plots are not suitable for studying the evolution of individual data series.","47":"The purpose of Thought Experiments is to systematically ask \"What if\" questions, challenging our assumptions about the world and potentially transforming our understanding of it.","48":"Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future.","49":"The Besatzfisch project employed a variety of methods including measuring fish population dynamics, questioning anglers about economic implications, modeling decision-making processes, conducting participatory workshops, and developing social-ecological models."},"contexts":{"0":["'''In short:''' T-tests can be used to investigate whether there is a significant difference between two groups regarding a mean value (two-sample t-test) or the mean in one group compared to a fixed value (one-sample t-test). \n\nThis entry focuses on two-sample T-tests and covers the concept and purpose of the t-test, underlying assumptions, its implementation in R, as well as multiple variants for different conditions.

The idea was to listen to planners' analysis of the global business environment in 1965 and, by doing so, Shell practically invented Scenario Planning. The system enabled Shell to first look ahead for six years, before expanding their planning horizon until 2000. The scenarios prepared Shell's management to deal with the 1973 and 1981 oil crises (1). Shell's success popularized the method. By 1982,","'''Shortly after, Scenario Planning was heavily furthered through corporate planning, most notably by the oil company Shell.'''
