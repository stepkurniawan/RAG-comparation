1|What is the ANOVA a powerful for?|Reducing variance in field experiments or complex laboratory experiments|['The ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses. The reproducibility crisis has proven that there are limits to deductive approaches, or at least to the knowledge these experiments produce. The 20th century was certainly fuelled in its development by experimental designs that were at their heart analysed by the ANOVA. However, we have to acknowledge that there are limits to the knowledge that can be produced, and more complex analysis methods evolved with the wider availability of computers.']|0.9999999999|1.0

Fisher's experiments on agricultural fields focused on taming variance within experiments through the use of replicates, yet he was strongly aware that underlying factors such as different agricultural fields and their unique combinations of environmental factors would inadvertedly impact the results. He thus developed the random factor implementation, and Charles Roy Henderson took this to the next level by creating the necessary calculations to allow for linear unbiased estimates. These approaches allowed for the development of previously unmatched designs in terms of the complexity of hypotheses that could be tested, and also opened the door to the analysis of complex datasets that are beyond the sphere of purely deductively designed datasets. It is thus not surprising that Mixed Effect Models rose to prominence in such diverse disciplines as""]"|0.9999999999|1.0
35|How do Mixed Effect Models compare to Analysis of Variance and Regressions in terms of statistical power and handling complex datasets?|Mixed Effect Models surpass Analysis of Variance in terms of statistical power and eclipse Regressions by being better able to handle the complexities of real world datasets.|"[""Typically, the diverse algorithmic foundations to calculate Mixed Effect Models (such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) allow for more statistical power, which is why Mixed Effect Models often work slightly better compared to standard regressions. The main strength of Mixed Effect Models is however not how they can deal with fixed effects, but that they are able to incorporate random effects as well. '''The combination of these possibilities makes (generalised) Mixed Effect Models the swiss army knife of univariate statistics.''' No statistical model to date is able to analyse a broader range of data, and Mixed Effect Models are the gold standard in deductive designs.""]"|0.9999999999|0.5
36|Why should stepwise procedures in model reduction be avoided?|Stepwise procedures in model reduction should be avoided because they are not smart but brute force approaches based on statistical evaluations, and they do not include any experience or preconceived knowledge. They are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way.|['The most blunt approach to any form of model reduction of a maximum model is a stepwise procedure. Based on p-values or other criteria such as AIC, a stepwise procedure allow to boil down any given model until only significant or otherwise statistically meaningful variables remain. While you can start from a maximum model that is boiled down which equals a backward selection, and a model starting with one predictor that subsequently adds more and more predictor variables and is named a forward selection, there is even a combination of these two. Stepwise procedures and not smart but brute force approaches that are only based on statistical evaluations, yet not necessarily very good ones. No experience or preconceived knowledge is included, hence such stepwise procedures are nothing but buckshot approaches that boil any given dataset down, and are not prone against many of the errors that may happen along the way. Hence stepwise procedures should be avoided at all costs, or at least be seen as the non-smart brute force tool they are.']|0.9999999999|1.0

38|How are 'narratives' used in Narrative Research?|'Narratives' in Narrative Research are used as a form of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. They are not just representations of events, but a way of making sense of the world, linking events in meaning. They reflect the perspectives of the storyteller and their social contexts, and are subject to change over time as new events occur and perspectives evolve.|"[""'''As a scientific method, Narrative Research - often just phrased 'narrative' - is a rather recent phenomenon''' (Barrett & Stauffer 2009; Clandinin 2006, see Squire et al. 2014). Narratives have developed towards modes of scientific inquiry in various disciplines in Social Sciences, including the arts, anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology, and educational science (Barrett & Stauffer 2009). This development paralleled an increasing role of qualitative research during the second half of the 20th Century, and built on the understanding of 'narrative' as both a form of story and a form of meaning-making of the human experience. Today, Narrative Research may be used across a wide range of disciplines and is an increasingly applied form in educational research (Moen 2006, Stauffer & Barrett 2009, Webster & Mertova 2007).""]"|0.9999999999|1.0
39|What are Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and what are their advantages and disadvantages?|Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are statistical models developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to handle non-linear dynamics. These models can compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion and outperform linear models when predictors follow a non-linear pattern. However, this comes at the cost of potentially losing the ability to infer causality when explaining the modeled patterns.|"['Over the last decades, many types of [[Statistics|statistical]] models emerged that are better suited to deal with such non-linear dynamics. One of the most prominent approaches is surely that of Generalized Additive Models (GAM), which represents a statistical revolution. Much can be said about all the benefits of these models, which in a nutshell are - based on a smooth function - able to compromise predictor variables in a non-linear fashion. Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (see Key Publications) were responsible for developing these models and matching them with [[Generalised Linear Models]]. By building on more computer-intense approaches, such as penalized restricted likelihood calculation, GAMs are able to outperform linear models if predictors follow a non-linear fashion, which seems trivial in itself. This comes however with a high cost, since the ability of higher model fit comes - at least partly - with the loss of our ability to infer [[Causality|causality]] when explaining the']"|0.9999999999|1.0

42|What is the 'curse of dimensionality'?|The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning, including sparsity of data points, increased difficulty in learning, and complications in data visualization and interpretation.|"[""=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features / dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in). Thus, data visualization and intepretation become much harder, and computational costs of model training greatly increases.
