Source: pixabay]]\n\n'''What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency.''' Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional"", 'von Forschenden und anderen Akteur*innen, die Anerkennung von [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|Komplexität]] in Systemen und die Notwendigkeit von Machtverhältnissen in der Wissensproduktion sind prominente Beispiele für aktuelle Herausforderungen, die Methodologien bisher nicht gelöst haben.

It often occurs in fields like engineering, finance, or economics to analyze trends and patterns over time. Time series data is typically numeric data, for example, the stock price of a specific stock, sampled at an hourly interval, over a time frame of several months. It could also be sensory data from a fitness tracker, sampling the heart rate every 30 seconds, or a GPS track of the last run.\nIn this article, we will see examples from a household energy consumption dataset having data for longer than a year, obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaganadhg/house-hold-energy-data Kaggle] (Download date: 20.12.2022). \n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=""Python"" line>\nimport numpy as np ## to prepare your data\nimport pandas as pd ## to prepare', ""interface.
