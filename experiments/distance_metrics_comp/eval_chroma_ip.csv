0,Why is acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law challenging in the contexts of agency?,Acknowledging serendipity and Murphy's law is challenging in the contexts of agency because lucky or unlucky actions that were not anticipated by the agents are not included in the definition of agency.,"[""react to their environment, but do they also act intentionally?''' Source: pixabay]]\n\n'''What is relevant to consider is that actions of agents need to be wilful, i.e. a mere act that can be seen as serendipity is not part of agency.''' Equally, non-anticipated consequences of actions based on causal chains are a problem in agency. Agency is troubled when it comes to either acknowledging serendipity, or Murphy's law. Such lucky or unlucky actions were not anticipated by the agents, and are therefore not really included in the definition of agency. There is thus a metaphysical problem when we try to differentiate the agent, their actions, and the consequences of their actions. One could claim that this can be solved by focussing on the consequences of the actions of agents alone. However, this consequentialist view is partly a theoretical consideration, as this view can create many interesting experiments, but does not really help us to solve the problem of unintentional"", 'von Forschenden und anderen Akteur*innen, die Anerkennung von [[Agency, Complexity and Emergence|Komplexität]] in Systemen und die Notwendigkeit von Machtverhältnissen in der Wissensproduktion sind prominente Beispiele für aktuelle Herausforderungen, die Methodologien bisher nicht gelöst haben.

Man könnte argumentieren, dass wir diese methodischen Probleme nie ganz lösen werden, sondern dass die gemeinsame Aktion und Interaktion bei der Arbeit an diesen Problemen die eigentliche Lösung sein wird, und dass eine wirkliche Lösung wie bei den bisherigen Methoden der Normalwissenschaft nie erreicht werden wird.

All this has consequences for the methods we apply, and the questions whether we observe or test premises has in addition further methodologial ramifications. '''I can interview individuals, yet this will hardly allow me to prove agency.'''

1,What are the key principles and assumptions of ANCOVA?,"ANCOVA compares group means while controlling for covariate influence, uses hypothesis testing, and considers Sum of Squares.

It is optional because it is only required to simplify the model for estimation of adjusted means.\n\n\n==What is One-way ANCOVA?==\nOne-way ANCOVA compares the variance in the group means within a sample with only one independent variable or factor that has three or more than three categorical groups whilst considering the coavriate. Since ANCOVA is hypothesis-based test, we need to have a understanding and well developed question about our data that we want an answer to, before we can generate a hypothesis and run the test.\n\n\n===Data preparation===\nIn order to demonstrate One-way ANCOVA test we will refer to balanced dataset ""anxiety"" taken', '\'\'\'In short:\'\'\'\nAnalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a statistical test that compares the means of more than two groups by taking under the control the ""noise"" caused by covariate variable that is not of experimental interest.

This is done in order to see the true effect of the variable of interest on a dependent variable. Fundamental idea of ANCOVA is based on hypothesis testing, its goal is to evaluate multiple mutually exclusive theories about our [[Glossary|data]], where null hypothesis claims that the means of the groups are equal, and alternative [[Glossary|hypothesis]] rejects that based on p-value. Additionally, it is important to highlight that ANCOVA also gives information on variables by means of Sum of Squares partitioning that shows the size of error or unexplained information in relation. Since ANCOVA historically comes from the combination of Linear regression and ANOVA, one should meet the assumptions inherent from them as well as specific to ANCOVA before proceeding to the ANCOVA test.\n\n== Assumptions ==\n\'\'\'Regression assumptions\'\'\'  \n# The relationship between dependent and independent variables must be linear for']",0.5833333333041666,1.0
