However, these tests assume that the data is normally distributed, which may not always be the case. In cases where the data is not normally distributed, nonparametric tests such as the [https:\/\/data.library.virginia.edu\/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test\/ Wilcoxon rank sum test] may be more appropriate.\n\n==Advantages and Limitations of A\/B Testing==\n'''Advantages'''\nA\/B testing has several advantages over traditional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a product or design. First, it allows for a more controlled and systematic comparison of the treatment and control version. Second, it allows for the random assignment of users to the treatment and control groups, reducing the potential for bias. Third, it allows for the collection of data over a period of time, which can provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages,","provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n'''Limitations'''\nDespite its advantages, A\/B testing also has some limitations. For example, it is only applicable to products or designs that can be easily compared in a controlled manner. In addition, the results of an A\/B test may not always be generalizable to the broader population, as the sample used in the test may not be representative of the population as a whole. Furthermore, it is not always applicable, as it requires a clear separation between control and treatment, and it may not be suitable for testing complex products or processes, where the relationship between the control and treatment versions is not easily defined or cannot be isolated from other factors that may affect the outcome.\n\nOverall, A\/B testing is a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of software or design changes. By setting up a controlled experiment and collecting data, we can make evidence-based decisions about whether a change should be implemented.\n\n==Key Publications==\nKohavi, Ron, and","'''THIS ARTICLE IS STILL IN EDITING MODE'''\n==A\/B Testing in a nutshell==\nA\/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method used to compare the performance of two versions of a product or content. This is done by randomly assigning similarly sized audiences to view either the control version (version A) or the treatment version (version B) over a set period of time and measuring their effect on a specific metric, such as clicks, conversions, or engagement. This method is commonly used in the optimization of websites, where the control version is the default version, while the treatment version is changed in a single variable, such as the content of text, colors, shapes, size or positioning of elements on the website.\n\n[[File:AB_Test.jpg|500px|thumb|center]]\n\n\nAn important advantage of A\/B testing is its ability to establish causal relationships with a high degree of probability, which can transform decision making from an intuitive process to a scientific,"],"1":["with the type 3 ANOVA allowing for the testing of unbalanced designs, where sample sizes differ between different categories levels. The Analysis of Variance is implemented into all standard statistical software, such as R and SPSS. However, differences in the calculation may occur when it comes to the calculation of unbalanced designs. \n\n\n== Strengths & Challenges ==\nThe ANOVA can be a powerful tool to tame the variance in field experiments or more complex laboratory experiments, as it allows to account for variance in repeated experimental measures of experiments that are built around replicates. The ANOVA is thus the most robust method when it comes to the design of deductive experiments, yet with the availability of more and more data, also inductive data has increasingly been analysed by use of the ANOVA. This was certainly quite alien to the original idea of Fisher, who believed in clear robust designs and rigid testing of hypotheses.

'''The ANOVA allows to compare several groups in terms of their mean values, and even to test for interaction between different independent variables.''' The strength of the model can be approximated by the amount of explained variance, and the p-value indicates whether the different groups within the independent variables differ overall. One can however also test whether one groups differs from another groups, thus comparing all groups individually by means of a posthoc test (e.g. Tukey).\n\nWhen designing an ANOVA study, great care needs to be taken to have sufficient samples to allow for a critical interpretation of the results. Subsequently, ANOVA experiments became more complex, combining several independent variables and also allowing to correct for so called random factors, which are elements for which the variance is calculated out of the","of the most revolutionary methodological textbooks of all time, changing agriculture and enabling exponential growth of the human population.\n[[File:Yield.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Does the soil influence the yield?

Both disciplines readily accepted the ANOVA as their main method in early systematic experiments, since comparing different treatments is quite relevant when it comes to their experimental setups.
