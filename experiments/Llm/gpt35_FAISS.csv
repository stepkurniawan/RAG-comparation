What is the ANOVA powerful for?,ANOVA is powerful for reducing variance in field experiments or to account for variance in repeated measures of experiments.,"The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is powerful for comparing several groups in terms of their mean values and testing for interaction between different independent variables.

What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to probability?,"Thomas Bayes introduced a different approach to probability that relied on small or imperfect samples for statistical inference. Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent opposite ends of the spectrum, with frequentist methods requiring specific conditions like sample size and a normal distribution, while Bayesian methods work with existing data.","The frequentist approach to probability focuses on the long-run frequency of events. It relies on repeated sampling to understand the distribution of probabilities across a phenomenon. In frequentist statistics, probabilities are seen as objective properties of the data generating process.

On the other hand, the Bayesian approach to probability is based on subjective beliefs and prior knowledge. It incorporates prior information and updates it with new data to obtain posterior probabilities. Bayesian statistics view probabilities as measures of uncertainty or degrees of belief.

Critical theory allows researchers to critically examine the underlying assumptions and biases within scientific methods and systems, promoting a more holistic and inclusive approach.

What is system thinking?,"System thinking is a method of investigation that considers interactions and interdependencies within a system, instead of breaking it into parts.","System thinking is a scientific approach to understanding and organizing systems. It involves analyzing the structures and causal relationships within a system to gain insights and solve problems. System thinking recognizes that social systems, such as organizations or ecosystems, are complex and include diverse perspectives and interests.

They represent factors that we are specifically interested in and want to examine their effects on the outcome variable. On the other hand, random factors are variables whose variance we want to ignore or control for. They are often used to account for sources of variability that are not of primary interest in the study. Random factors are typically included in the analysis to reduce the impact of their variability on the outcome variable. The distinction between fixed and random factors is determined by the researcher and depends on the specific research question and design of the study.","[Document(page_content='fixed or a random] factor is often difficult to consider.

Within most medical trials the information whether someone smokes or not is a random factor, since it is known that smoking influences much of what these studies might be focusing about. This is of course different if these studies focus explicitly on the effects of smoking. Then smoking would be a fixed factor, and the fact whether someone smokes or not is part of the research. Typically, factors that are part of a block design are random factors, and variables that are constructs relating to our hypothesis are fixed variables.

What is the replication crisis and how does it affect modern research?,"The replication crisis refers to the inability to reproduce a substantial proportion of modern research, affecting fields like psychology, medicine, and economics.

First of all, at a threshold of p=0.05, a certain arbitrary amount of models can be expected to be significant purely by chance. Second, studies are often flawed through the connection between theory and methodological design, where for instance much of the dull results remains unpublished, and statistical designs can biased towards a specific results. Third, statistics slowly eroded into a culture where more complex models and the rate of statistical fishing increased.

The reproducibility crisis in psychology is one example of these developments, yet all other disciplines building on statistics struggle to this end, too. Another problem is the fact that with this [[Questioning the status quo in methods|ever-increasing demand for ""scientific innovation""]], models evolve, and it is hard to catch up. \'\'\'Thus, instead of having robust and parsimonious models, there are more and more unsuitable and overcomplicated models.\'\'\' The'), Document(page_content='other fields] of production to thrive, but then also did medicine, [https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html psychology], ecology and even [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0372-0 economics] use experimental approaches to test specific questions.

2. Cluster diagrams: These diagrams show the grouping or clustering of data points based on their similarity or dissimilarity. They are useful for identifying patterns or clusters within the data.

3. Network plots: These plots represent the relationships between different entities or variables as a network or graph. Nodes represent the entities, and edges represent the connections or relationships between them.

How are 'narratives' used in Narrative Research?,"'Narratives' in Narrative Research are used as a form of communication that people apply to make sense of their life experiences. They are not just representations of events, but a way of making sense of the world, linking events in meaning. They reflect the perspectives of the storyteller and their social contexts, and are subject to change over time as new events occur and perspectives evolve.","In Narrative Research, narratives are used as the primary data source. Researchers collect stories or narratives from individuals and analyze them to understand how people experience the world and make meaning of their experiences. These narratives can be in the form of personal stories, interviews, diaries, or any other form of storytelling. The focus is on the narrative elements, such as the structure, themes, and meanings conveyed through the story. Researchers may also examine the narrative context, which refers to the effects of the story on individuals or society. Overall, narratives are central to Narrative Research as they provide insights into people's lived experiences and subjective perspectives.","[Document(page_content='2007, Squire et al. 2014, Moen 2006). \n\nNarrative Research is ""(...) the study of stories"" (Polkinghorne 2007, p.471) and thus ""(...) the study of how human beings experience the world, and narrative researchers collect these stories and write narratives of experience.""

What is the 'curse of dimensionality'?,"The 'curse of dimensionality' refers to the challenges of dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning, including sparsity of data points, increased difficulty in learning, and complications in data visualization and interpretation.","The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenges and limitations that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features or dimensions increases, the distance between data points becomes larger, resulting in sparsity and making it difficult to apply machine learning methods effectively. The curse of dimensionality also leads to difficulties in data visualization and interpretation, as higher-dimensional spaces have counter-intuitive properties. Additionally, the computational costs of model training significantly increase in higher dimensions. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a method that helps alleviate the curse of dimensionality by reducing the dimensionality of the data.","[Document(page_content=""curse of dimensionality.\n\n=== Curse of dimensionality ===\nThis term was coined by Richard R. Bellman, an American applied mathematician. As the number of features / dimensions increases, the distance among data points grows exponential. Things become really sparse as the instances lie very far away from each other. This makes applying machine learning methods much more difficult, since there is a certain relationship between the number of features and the number of training data. In short, with higher dimensions you need to gather much more data for learning to actually occur, which leaves a lot of room for error. Moreover, higher-dimension spaces have many counter-intuitive properties, and the human mind, as well as most data analysis tools, is used to dealing with only up to three dimensions (like the world we are living in).

What is the purpose of Thought Experiments?,"The purpose of Thought Experiments is to systematically ask ""What if"" questions, challenging our assumptions about the world and potentially transforming our understanding of it.","The purpose of Thought Experiments is to explore and speculate on modifications, manipulations, or completely new states of the world. They allow us to consider different possibilities, test assumptions, and examine the consequences of hypothetical scenarios. Thought Experiments can help us gain insights, challenge existing beliefs, and stimulate critical thinking. They are a way to engage in open discourse and explore the implications of various choices and decisions.","[Document(page_content='style=""width: 33%""| \'\'\'[[:Category:Past|Past]]\'\'\' || style=""width: 33%""| \'\'\'[[:Category:Present|Present]]\'\'\' || \'\'\'[[:Category:Future|Future]]\'\'\'\n|}\n<br/>__NOTOC__\n<br/><br/>\n\'\'\'In short:\'\'\' Thought Experiments are systematic speculations that allow to explore modifications, manipulations or completly new states of the world.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Scopus hits Thought Experiment.png|450px|thumb|right|\'\'\'SCOPUS hits per year for Thought Experiments until 2019.\'\'\' Search term: \'thought experiment\' in Title, Abstract, Keywords.

We might consider all different option about alternative states of the world, yet we have to acknowledge that humankind has a long history of being wrong in terms of our assumptions about the world. In other words, while Thought Experiments are so fantastic because they can be unburdened by reality, this automatically means that they are also potentially different from reality. Another potential flaw of Thought Experiments is that they are only as good as our assumptions and reflections about the world.

In other words, there is no right or wrong answer, but instead, the experiments are a form of open discourse. While thus some Thought Experiments may be designed to imply a presumpted answer, many famous Thought Experiments are completely open, and potential answers reflect the underlying norms and moral constructs of people. Hence Thought Experiments are not only normative in their design, but especially in terms of the possible answers of results.  \n\nThe easiest way to set up a Thought Experiment is to ask yourself a ""What if"" question. Many Thought Experiments resolve around decisions, choices or potential states of the future. A famous example is the Trolley experiment, where a train rolls towards five train track workers, who would all be killed be the oncoming train, unaware of their potential demise. You can now change the direction of the train, and lead it to another track. There, one worker would be killed. Uncountable numbers')]"
What is temporal autocorrelation?,Temporal autocorrelation is a principle that states humans value events in the near past or future more than those in the distant past or future.,Temporal autocorrelation refers to the degree of similarity or correlation between observations in a time series at different points in time. It measures the relationship between a given data point and previous data points in the same series. Temporal autocorrelation is also known as serial correlation or lagged correlation. It is commonly used in time series analysis to understand the patterns and dependencies within the data.,"[Document(page_content='hours spent at home (and when it is dark), days in home office, temperature (if heating requires electricity), and many other.\n\n===Autocorrelation===\nAutocorrelation measures the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself.
